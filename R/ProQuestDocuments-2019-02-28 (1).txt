Full text: (CNN) - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, una latina de 28 años que participa en su primera campaña, derrotó al representante Joe Crowley —que lleva 10 periodos en el cargo— en el decimocuarto distrito congresista de Nueva York, proyecta CNN, en el enfrentamiento más impactante de una temporada política dinámica.
Ocasio-Cortez, activista y miembro de los Socialistas Democráticos de Estados Unidos, se ganó a los votantes en el distrito donde las minorías son mayoría con una oferta eficiente para las bases, incluso cuando Crowley, demócrata de cuarto rango en la Cámara de Representantes, la excedió en financiación por un margen de 10 a 1.
Esta es la primera vez en 14 años que un demócrata intenta derrotar a Crowley, quien preside a los demócratas del condado de Queens. Su derrota marca un cambio radical potencial en la política del partido, un resultado con implicaciones para los demócratas a nivel nacional que recordaría —algo que los progresistas señalaron durante la campaña— la pérdida del exlíder de la mayoría republicana Eric Cantor ante el insurgente Dave Brat, respaldado por el Tea Party en junio ​​de 2014.
A pesar de que Ocasio-Cortez se inclina desafiantemente a la izquierda —con propuestas como atención médica universal, garantía federal de empleo y la abolición de ICE encabezando sus planes— Crowley se apoyó en lo que es un evidente récord liberal. Fue el primer miembro del liderazgo demócrata de la Cámara que firmó en apoyo de "Medicare para todos" y ha sido un firme defensor de los derechos de los inmigrantes. Pero Crowley tuvo varios tropiezos en la campaña, el probable residuo de pasar tanto tiempo sin una contienda en las primarias del partido.
Ocasio-Cortez también ha estado en primera línea, como el fin de semana pasado, cuando viajó para unirse a las protestas en un centro de detención de ICE en Texas, una reacción de los progresistas contra las políticas fronterizas y de inmigración de la administración Trump. Ocasio-Cortez ha sido una impulsora de la abolición de esa agencia, un tema que ella relaciona con la población diversa de su distrito.

Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trade supportive tweets after N.Y. primary

Full text: Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley wasted no time on Tuesday night congratulating so-called “Democratic Giant Slayer" and Boston University alumna Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who defeated New York's Congressman Joseph Crowley Tuesday night.
Pressley, who is running to unseat Representative Michael Capuano, tweeted a photo of the two and wrote, “together, we will change the world."
Early Wednesday morning, Ocasio-Cortez in turn urged Massachusetts voters to back Pressley in September.
She quoted Pressley as she responded to a reporter highlighting her background as a bartender and wrote, “Vote her in next, Massachusetts."
Pressley and Ocasio-Cortez have strikingly similar stories: Both are women of color facing white male opponents who have served in Congress since 1998. Both attended Boston University. Both worked for former US senators from Massachusetts (Ocasio-Cortez for the late Ted Kennedy and Pressley for John Kerry). Both ran to the left of their opponents, though Pressley shares many of the same policy positions as Capuano, and Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Full text: (CNN) - Y tú la conocerás por su nombre.
Un día antes de que Alejandría Ocasio-Cortez, de 28 años, lograra su notable victoria en las primarias demócratas en el 14 - Distrito Congresional de Nueva York, se tomó un momento para observar cómo se la describía en la prensa política.
"Una chica no tiene nombre: titulares del patriarcado político", escribió en Twitter. En los tabloides y en algunas estaciones de televisión locales, ella era, una y otra vez, simplemente el "oponente principal" del representante Joe Crowley.

Un poco más de 24 horas después, eso está empezando a cambiar. Ocasio-Cortez se está convirtiendo rápidamente en un nombre familiar.
Su triunfo el martes corona un ascenso notable, lo que probablemente la convierta en la persona más joven en el Congreso en 2019. En caso de que derrote a su oponente republicano, llegará a Washington con una agenda progresista clara: presionar por "Medicare para todos", "la abolición de la Ley de Inmigración y Aduanas de Estados Unidos y la legislación para sacar grandes cantidades de dinero de la política".
La propia historia de Ocasio-Cortez comienza en el Bronx, el mismo distrito que, junto con partes de Queens, le cumplieron el día de las primarias. Nació y creció allí, hija de padres puertorriqueños de clase trabajadora: su padre nació en el sur del Bronx (murió en 2008, mientras ella estaba en la universidad); su madre, en la isla. Ella estudió en la Universidad de Boston y trabajó en la oficina del senador liberal Lion Ted Kennedy de Massachusetts.
Cuando regresó a casa, Ocasio-Cortez trabajó como organizadora comunitaria y, finalmente, con tensiones económicas enraizadas en la recesión y la pérdida de su padre, comenzó un trabajo de baja remuneración y muchas horas en restaurantes para ayudar a mantener a su familia.
Durante la temporada presidencial de 2016, trabajó como organizadora del senador Bernie Sanders, quien se postuló en las primarias demócratas. En 2017, Ocasio-Cortez lanzó su campaña para derrocar a Crowley, el poderoso demócrata que preside el partido en el condado de Queens.
Su candidatura comenzó a ganar fuerza y Crowley, que no había sido desafiado en más de una década, comenzó a mostrar su debilidad, a principios de este año. Crowley consternó al consejo editorial de The New York Times por no presentarse a un debate en contra de su oponente, citando conflictos de programación.
En declaraciones a Poppy Harlow de CNN el miércoles por la mañana, Ocasio-Cortez enfatizó que su campaña logró tocar las puertas a las que normalmente no llega el establishment demócrata: "los jóvenes... las comunidades de color, las personas que hablan inglés como segunda lengua, la clase trabajadora, personas con dos trabajos que suelen estar demasiado 'ocupadas' para votar".
"Cuando las personas sienten que se les está hablando directamente", dijo en 'CNN Newsroom', "Siento que... harán cosas como asistir a una primaria a mitad de año".
"Es el momento para una Nueva York que funcione para todos nosotros.
El 26 de junio podemos hacer que ocurra, pero solo si tenemos el #corajeparacambiar.
Es hora de ponerse a trabajar. Por favor, retuitea este video y regístrese para tocar puertas. Más en http://Ocasio2018.com para llevar nuestro movimiento al Congreso", dijo Ocasio-Cortez en un tuit.

Aunque Crowley superó en recaudación a Ocasio-Cortez, miembro de los Socialistas Democráticos de América (DSA, en inglés) por un margen estremecedor de 10 a 1, su oferta fue supercargada con el lanzamiento de un anuncio en Internet a fines del mes pasado producido por un par de miembros compañeros de DSA.
"Se supone que las mujeres como yo no deben postularse para un cargo", dice Ocasio-Cortez al comienzo del anuncio viral de dos minutos.
Cualquiera que esté familiarizado con la maquinaria política de Nueva York se habría visto en apuros para descartar la línea de la retórica común en camapaña. Después de la noche del martes, será igual de difícil ignorar a Ocasio-Cortez.

Ocasio-Cortez’s Call for ‘US GDPR’ Gains Traction After Surprise Win

Full text: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez may have won in Brooklyn and Queens, but Silicon Valley should also watch out for her.
The 28-year-old first time candidate in New York’s 12th district (who was working as a bartender a year ago) defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in yesterday’s Democratic primary.
There are many reasons why Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign was unprecedented: She was a young woman of color and democratic socialist who campaigned on a platform of abolishing ICE, banning assault weapons and securing Medicare and higher education for all.
But one of the less discussed aspects of Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign could have a big impact on the tech industry if she wins November’s general election.
Ocasio-Cortez is one of the few candidates who’s called for antitrust action against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. She also wants America to have aggressive privacy regulations similar to Europe’s GDPR.
The millennial firebrand unveiled this aspect of her campaign in April, to coincide with Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony.
This isn’t just about Zuckerberg - this is about holding the tech industry accountable.
This is about antitrust.
This is about people owning their OWN data.
This is about corporations deputizing themselves with other people’s lives.
Ocasio2018 is now calling for a US GDPR. pic.twitter.com/Amb1io1Ddi
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) April 10, 2018
Ocasio-Cortez’s “privacy bill of rights” would prevent corporate overreach which compromises users’ privacy.
“It is time we set some ground rules around personal data” to “protect people from signing ALL their rights away to play FarmVille,” she tweeted at the time.
Pundits began re-sharing these social media missives last night as Ocasio-Cortez’s victory became assured.
And since her initial tweets, the calls for increased data privacy in America have grown even louder.
Most notably, the California Data Privacy Act was introduced in May and is likely headed to the ballot in November. It would impact anyone in the state who uses the internet.
This bill would require businesses to have a “clear and conspicuous link” on their website’s homepage titled “Do Not Sell My Personal Information.” The link would take users to a page where they can opt out of having their data sold or shared.
Businesses would also be required to disclose the categories of information they have on users-such as home addresses, employment information and characteristics such as race and gender.
Facebook and Google don’t totally lose under the proposed law: they would still be able to collect user data for ad targeting.
Greg Sparrow, senior vice president and general manager at risk mitigation consulting firm CompliancePoint, said the Data Privacy Act and Ocasio-Cortez’s victory prove consumers are fed up with their data being exploited.
“There’s an awareness in the United States that hasn’t traditionally been there,” Sparrow told Observer. “The U.S. has been really behind when it comes to data privacy, but the problem’s not going away.”
While state laws like the California act certainly help the cause, Sparrow expressed hope that Ocasio-Cortez could make this a national issue if she gets to Congress.
“Applying it as a consistent regulation across the board on the federal level would simplify things,” he said.
It’s also a consumer problem, however. Zuckerberg’s Senate testimony was a good start, but Sparrow said everyday internet users also need to keep pushing on these issues.
“Keeping it top of mind in the news cycle and the minds of consumers is key going forward,” he said. “They need to remember that if you’re not paying for the service, you are the service.”
Ocasio-Cortez definitely has her work cut out for her on privacy. But hey, she’s already surprised us once.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Twitter fights with Trump won't help progressive agenda

Full text: Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who ousted 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in Tuesday night’s Democratic primary in New York, said Wednesday that politicians can’t get into Twitter spats with President Trump if they want to move their agenda forward.

“What we need to do is lay out a plan and a vision that people can believe in, and getting into Twitter fights with the president is not exactly, I think, where we're going to find progress as a nation,” Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC when addressing the fact that she did not once say Trump’s name during her campaign.

Ocasio-Cortez also said that in order to achieve some of her agenda points such as "Medicare for all," tuition-free public universities and trade schools, and a federal jobs guarantee, Congress would need to have the courage to raise taxes and roll back tax cuts.

She also wants to rethink the cuts made under the George W. Bush administration in the early 2000s.

“It was when people precisely said, ‘we have the least amount of ability to do this,’ that we actually committed to an economically ambitious agenda that transformed the future and the course of this nation,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And I think that it is absolutely possible, but what it takes is the political courage to do it.”

The 28-year-old victor has the opportunity in the general elections in November to become the youngest woman elected to Congress.

In surprise win, 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beats 10-term Congressman in New York primaries

Full text: "This is the start of a movement," Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Wednesday morning after defeating 10-term Congressman Joseph Crowley in the House of Representatives. The 28-year-old Latina's win in the New York primary is being touted as one of the most shocking upsets in recent American political history. She has never held office.
Ocasio-Cortez describes herself as an educator, organiser and working-class New Yorker who has worked with expectant mothers, waited tables and led classrooms. She was also a volunteer in Bernie Sanders' 2016 Presidential campaign. Born to a mother from Puerto Rico and a father from South Bronx, she says she was raised in a place where one's zip code determines your destiny. "Going into politics wasn't in the plan. But after 20 years of the same representation, we have to ask: who has New York been changing for?" she asks in a promotional video for her campaign.
"This race is about people vs money; we've got people, they've got money," she says. Ocasio-Cortez has promised to represent working families and work towards lowering rent, increasing incomes and ensuring healthcare is accessible to more people.
It's time for a New York that works for all of us.
On June 26th, we can make it happen - but only if we have the #CourageToChange.

US President Donald Trump also reacted to Ocasio-Cortez's win. "This is a big one that nobody saw happening," he tweeted.
Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he's out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!
- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2018
Crowley, who congratulated Ocasio-Cortez, said he would support her in the general election. He said, "I want nothing but the best for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. I want her to be victorious." Crowley was in line to become the next House speaker if Democrats win majority.
Primaries were held in seven states - Colorado, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah - on Tuesday as voters picked candidates for the November 6 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Ocasio-Cortez’s view on Israel and Palestine received extensive media attention. The Democratic candidate expressed her support for the Palestinians during the Great March of Return in Gaza in which over 130 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces and a further 13,000 were injured.

Glenn Greenwald, a pundit with The Intercept, said the tweet got a lot of attention because it’s rare to see someone in mainstream politics talking in “such clear moral terms denouncing the Israeli government’s military aggression in that way”.
Asked by Greenwald if she felt she needed to take such a tough stance against Israel despite the political cost, Ocasio-Cortez said she was compelled to take the position she took regarding Palestine on moral grounds.

Referring to civil rights and labor rights protests held in the US in recent years, Ocasio-Cortez added:
“My background is as an educator, an organizer, and an activist. And I think I was primarily compelled on moral grounds because I can only imagine if 60 people were shot and killed in Ferguson, or if 60 people were shot in killed in the West Virginia teacher strikes.”

Mediaite: Lipstick Worn by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez During Debate Sells Out

Full text: While Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez instantly became a young Democrat icon after running to the left of powerful incumbent Congressman Joseph Crowley and winning, the democratic socialist candidate is quickly turning into a style icon as well. After she received inquiries from fans, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out the shade and brand of the lipstick she wore during her primary debate against Crowley, which quickly sold out on Twitter after she rose to national prominence. "I have been getting many inquiries about my debate lip color in the last two days," tweeted Ocasio-Cortez on June 17, just after the primary debate. "I GOT YOU. It's Stila "Stay All Day" Liquid in Beso."I have been getting many inquiries about my debate lip color in the last two days. I GOT YOU.

Of course, her lipstick is far from the only thing making waves in America. Ocasio-Cortez, who was previously an organizer for Senator Bernie Sanders , made abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency a cornerstone of her campaign, and the #AbolishICE talking point has quickly become popular among progressive voters. Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York even became the first person in the Senate to call for the abolishment of ICE, just after Ocasio-Cortez's victory.

Judith Timson: For women, being the first is still important - and still fraught

Full text: In the whirlwind that is our current news culture, the firsts for women still get plenty of media attention. We’re not yet ready to take these firsts for granted.
Ontario just said farewell to Kathleen Wynne, its first female — and openly gay — premier.
Wynne lasted five years and like her five other female provincial counterparts across the country, who shattered that particular glass ceiling, she had only one term to make her significant mark.
No one ever guaranteed that once a woman breaks a barrier, the job is hers to keep. Sometimes she finds herself quietly sweeping up the shards of glass as she ruefully contemplates what to do next.
In the last few weeks there have been some notable firsts.
On Tuesday June 19, Karina Gould, Liberal MP and Minister of Democratic Institutions did something no MP has done before: she breastfed her 3-month-old son Oliver during Question Period in the House of Commons. There’s viral video to prove it.
Look! There she is, sitting in her House of Commons seat, baby’s head against her breast, his tiny hand searching her shirt. No big deal.
“No shame in breastfeeding!” Gould cheerfully tweeted , “Baby’s gotta eat & I had votes. Clearly still work to do ... Glad @HoCSpeaker & parl colleagues supportive! :)”
I like to think Gould was not only doing what had to be done but slyly making a point. Our democratic institutions will not fall if a woman breastfeeds her baby in public.
There were congratulations but also tsk tsking about Gould showing a bit of breast. And one man groused on Twitter: “Was her son elected?” Your point, sir?
Wise words on Twitter from writer Sarah Boesveld summed up my own reaction: “Mixed feelings about this — on the one hand, what a nice show of support! On the other hand, not sure I’d want … attention on me while I’m trying to feed my baby? And the applause really underscores the fact that breastfeeding in public is really not totally accepted yet.”
When a well-meaning senior media guy began musing online about a parliamentary breastfeeding “booth” I checked out. It’s done, fellas, move on.
In New Zealand, the new mom/powerful job theme continued as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern became only the second female Prime Minister in the world to give birth while in office.
Benazir Bhutto, the late Prime Minister of Pakistan gave birth to a second child while in office in 1990. Since that was 28 years ago, consider Ardern a first in this century.
As Ardern received global congratulations on daughter Neve’s birth, she promised she would be back to work in six weeks and “reachable” until then (a deputy PM is in charge).
My favourite response was from columnist Chitra Ramaswamy in The Guardian, who archly noted the impossible standard this set for the rest of motherkind: “You, too, can expel a tiny human from your body and be up and running a country in six weeks. Inspiring, no?”
She added: “For those of us looking after babies in a society where workplace discrimination against mothers is standard, there is a disconnect between news affirming the victory of feminist choice and the domestic reality.”
Much closer to home, the recent firsts included a popular announcement among my fellow journalists that the Star would appoint managing editor Irene Gentle to be the first female editor-in-chief in its 126 year history.
Two of Toronto’s four daily newspapers already had female editors-in-chief but you celebrate each institutional breakthrough as the barriers fall. Gentle’s female counterparts, women in top media jobs in many different publications from all across the country jubilantly acknowledged this by jointly signing their names to a big bouquet of flowers. “It was the kindest, strongest, most powerful message I can imagine. I really do still get goosebumps every time I think of it,” said Gentle.
Powerful women know that each first matters.
Two more firsts: Chiefs of Ontario, an organization representing the province’s Indigenous chiefs just elected RoseAnne Archibald as its first female leader and regional chief.
And in New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a charismatic 28-year-old Hispanic political newbie — and acknowledged Democratic Socialist — shook the Democrat political world to its rafters by defeating powerful long-time Congressman Joe Crowley, in a safe Democratic seat in a district primary.
Ocasio-Cortez is now likely to become, by next November, the youngest congressional representative in history. She achieved this victory by focusing on her gender, her ethnicity, and her community roots. Her campaign video was fantastic.
More than a decade ago I was wondering aloud whether we even needed to acknowledge these firsts anymore. Did they matter, say, to a younger generation of women?
Remarkably it seems more important now than ever to celebrate the firsts. And not just because, for young girls and women, if you can’t see it, you can’t want to be it.
The #MeToo movement has shed a harsh light on how women have been bullied, sexually harassed, and held back on the job.
That movement — and the alarming political situation in the U.S. that may see the Supreme Court reshaped to deny women their reproductive rights — has made it even more urgent for women to reach the top in media, business and politics.
We need to get to the point where there are so many women in influential positions that a woman is no longer the first, second or even third woman to break that particular barrier.

Full text: Kerri Harris jumped into Delaware's U.S. Senate primary in February, offering Democrats an alternative to Sen. Thomas R. Carper. There didn't seem to be many takers. The 38-year-old Harris, a veteran and social worker, raised just $17,138 for her campaign, compared with Carper's $2.3 million. Even a friendly profile writer suggested that Harris was "tilting at a particularly formidable windmill."
Then in June, Harris had an idea — what if she helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a fellow insurgent candidate challenging Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.)? Her primary was on June 26; Harris's isn't until September. On June 25, Harris and five members of her campaign team piled into a Prius and a Toyota Highlander and drove the four hours to New York, ready to get out the vote.
"The guys in the Highlander drove past Sen. Carper," she said. "He was jogging."
Harris's road trip paid off. In just six days since Ocasio-Cortez's victory, Harris has netted more than $15,000 from 429 donors from 41 states and the District — almost as much as she had raised since the start of her campaign. She gained hundreds of social media followers, too, after an endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez was retweeted more than 10,000 times.
"The guys who didn't think we could win before are now believers," Harris said. "They know that we're energized and our voices are going to be heard. Inside the campaign, we all had that mentality before, but now we're showing this is real, this is how change happens."
Want to learn about another amazing candidate? Here's @KerriHarrisDE.
Kerri, running in Delaware, drove to New York HERSELF to get out the vote and outfitted her team in Ocasio2018 gear to do the same on Election Day.
She's a real one. Thank you Kerri! https://t.co/1TJBE3zfdu pic.twitter.com/AVgVG4IuwA

Ocasio-Cortez, whose upset victory made her an instant political star, has spent the days since then alternating between media interviews and endorsements of like-minded candidates. She'd always intended to turn her campaign staff over to other New York insurgents; many "AOC" campaign veterans are now focused on defeating Democratic state senators who caucused with Republicans.

Before my primary, Julia brought her team to help our field operation. She and I knocked doors together.
Now we return the favor.
If you're in NYC/Brooklyn, you can help her get on the ballot for September right now. https://t.co/LnAuaxUKWV

In races across the country, Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement has been an incredible signal-booster, drawing fresh attention to candidates who had been struggling for it. She has backed Brent Welder, a candidate for Congress in Kansas; Kaniela Ing, a candidate in Hawaii; Chardo Richardson, a candidate in Florida; and Abdul El-Sayed, a candidate for governor of Michigan who had sometimes gotten lost in a three-way race.
I believe a politics of working hard for economic, social, and racial justice can succeed anywhere in America.
Michigan is blessed to have @AbdulElSayedas a candidate for Governor, and I am proud to support him. https://t.co/H4NEtNHPWO pic.twitter.com/ZjQ7JcQXRv

All of the insurgent candidates are also endorsed by Justice Democrats, a group created in January 2017 with the express purpose of replacing "corporate Democrats" — politicians seen as overly programmed by their donors — with "progressives" in the mold of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Justice Democrats would endorse universal Medicare, a $15 minimum wage and free tuition at public universities, all while turning down any corporate PAC money. Cenk Uygur, co-founder of the Young Turks, co-founded Justice Democrats. He later left the leadership but used his YouTube-based news show to promote the candidates.
Until Tuesday, the Justice Democrats experiment did not have a major win to point to. It had been mostly successful in races in which the Democratic Party's establishment did not see a reason to compete, including in some deep-red districts in Texas. Last year, a similar primary-bad-Democrats effort, #AllOfUs, folded into Justice Democrats.
Ocasio-Cortez's victory changed those dynamics. According to Corbin Trent, a Justice Democrats co-founder who spent seven weeks working full-time for Ocasio-Cortez, this was the dream all along — one breakthrough candidate who demonstrates that incumbents are beatable.
"We talked about going all-in for AOC a year ago," Trent said. "She embodied so much of what we wanted to accomplish. Not everyone is happy about how the attention moved toward her — not toward them — but the ones who realize what's happening, they're absolutely excited. They know this is good for their races."
Since June 26, Trent said, fundraising for Justice Democrats has doubled, even though the group is not always mentioned in stories about Ocasio-Cortez. "I get that 'socialist' sells more newspapers than 'Justice Democrats,' " he said.
At a glance, many of the Justice Democrats have tougher primaries than Ocasio-Cortez. Carper, who at 71 has been winning elections in Delaware for most of his life, has a more favorable and moderate-leaning primary electorate than Crowley did. El-Sayed trails two other candidates in Michigan; Ing is near the back of the pack in his Hawaii race. (Ing, like Ocasio-Cortez, is a member of Democratic Socialists of America.) But Ocasio-Cortez's win is getting them a second look from the news media, which does not want to miss another upset, and donors, who are eager to rally behind another "impossible" cause.

Full text: In the whirlwind that is our current news culture, the firsts for women still get plenty of media attention. We're not yet ready to take these firsts for granted.
Ontario just said farewell to Kathleen Wynne, its first female - and openly gay - premier.
Wynne lasted five years and like her five other female provincial counterparts across the country who shattered that particular glass ceiling, she had only one term to make her significant mark.
No one ever guaranteed that once a woman breaks a barrier, the job is hers to keep. Sometimes she finds herself quietly sweeping up the shards of glass as she ruefully contemplates what to do next.
In the last few weeks, there have been some notable firsts.
On June 19, Karina Gould, Liberal MP and minister of democratic institutions, did something no MP has done before: she breastfed her 3-month-old son Oliver during Question Period in the House of Commons. There's viral video to prove it.
Look! There she is, sitting in her House of Commons seat, baby's head against her breast, his tiny hand searching her shirt. No big deal.
"No shame in breastfeeding!" Gould cheerfully tweeted, "Baby's gotta eat & I had votes. Clearly still work to do ... Glad @HoCSpeaker & parl colleagues supportive! :)"
I like to think Gould was not only doing what had to be done but also slyly making a point. Our democratic institutions will not fall if a woman breastfeeds her baby in public.
There were congratulations but also tsk tsking about Gould showing a bit of breast. And one man groused on Twitter: "Was her son elected?" Your point, sir?
Wise words on Twitter from writer Sarah Boesveld summed up my own reaction: "Mixed feelings about this - on the one hand, what a nice show of support! On the other hand, not sure I'd want ... attention on me while I'm trying to feed my baby? And the applause really underscores the fact that breastfeeding in public is really not totally accepted yet."
When a well-meaning senior media guy began musing online about a parliamentary breastfeeding "booth" I checked out. It's done, fellas, move on.
In New Zealand, the new mom/powerful job theme continued as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern became only the second female prime minister in the world to give birth while in office.
Benazir Bhutto, the late prime minister of Pakistan, gave birth to a second child while in office in 1990. Since that was 28 years ago, consider Ardern a first in this century.
As Ardern received global congratulations on daughter Neve's birth, she promised she would be back to work in six weeks and "reachable" until then (a deputy PM is in charge).
My favourite response was from columnist Chitra Ramaswamy in the Guardian, who archly noted the impossible standard this set for the rest of motherkind: "You, too, can expel a tiny human from your body and be up and running a country in six weeks. Inspiring, no?"
She added: "For those of us looking after babies in a society where workplace discrimination against mothers is standard, there is a disconnect between news affirming the victory of feminist choice and the domestic reality."
Much closer to home, the recent firsts included a popular announcement among my fellow journalists that the Star would appoint managing editor Irene Gentle to be the first female editor-in-chief in its 126-year history.
Two of Toronto's four daily newspapers already had female editors-in-chief, but you celebrate each institutional breakthrough as the barriers fall. Gentle's female counterparts, women in top media jobs in many different publications from all across the country, jubilantly acknowledged this by jointly signing their names to a big bouquet of flowers. "It was the kindest, strongest, most powerful message I can imagine. I really do still get goosebumps every time I think of it," Gentle said.
Powerful women know that each first matters.
Two more firsts: Chiefs of Ontario, an organization representing the province's Indigenous chiefs, just elected RoseAnne Archibald as its first female leader and regional chief.
And in New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a charismatic 28-year-old Hispanic political newbie - and acknowledged Democratic Socialist - shook the Democrat political world to its rafters by defeating powerful longtime Congressman Joe Crowley in a safe Democratic seat in a district primary.
Ocasio-Cortez is now likely to become, by next November, the youngest congressional representative in history. She achieved this victory by focusing on her gender, her ethnicity and her community roots. Her campaign video was fantastic.
More than a decade ago, I was wondering aloud whether we even needed to acknowledge these firsts anymore. Did they matter, say, to a younger generation of women?
Remarkably it seems more important now than ever to celebrate the firsts. And not just because, for young girls and women, if you can't see it, you can't want to be it.
The #MeToo movement has shed a harsh light on how women have been bullied, sexually harassed and held back on the job.
That movement - and the alarming political situation in the U.S. that may see the Supreme Court reshaped to deny women their reproductive rights - has made it even more urgent for women to reach the top in media, business and politics.
We need to get to the point where there are so many women in influential positions that a woman is no longer the first, second or even third woman to break that particular barrier.
That's when it will really be no big deal.

A Shooting Star Tries to Carry Female Officeseekers Upward

Full text: In the afterglow of her upset over Representative Joseph Crowley in the New York Democratic primary, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made it clear that her campaign work was not done.
As she stood atop a table in a packed Bronx billiards hall to deliver her victory speech, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez -- who by morning would be one of the most talked-about names in American politics -- reeled off a list of other progressive candidates she said needed to be sent to Congress: Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts, for example, or Cori Bush in Missouri.
By morning, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had also trumpeted Ms. Bush and Ms. Pressley to her fast-growing Twitter following. Within the week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had dispatched her volunteers to canvass for Cynthia Nixon, Zephyr Teachout and Julia Salazar, candidates for New York governor, attorney general and State Senate.
Ms. Pressley gained 5,000 Twitter followers in 24 hours. More than 120 volunteers have signed up for Ms. Teachout's campaign this week. In the same period, Ms. Salazar has raised more than $20,000.
"All my social media went nuts, my email went nuts, and donations took off exponentially," said Ms. Bush, who watched the victory speech in tears from her home in Missouri. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Bush is challenging a longtime Democratic incumbent. "It has totally changed our race."
It is by no means certain that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's victory over Mr. Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House, can be replicated. Her grass-roots organizing, politics and persona were an ideal match for a district that has undergone sharp demographic and geographic changes since Mr. Crowley was first elected; other candidates may also find that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's brand of democratic socialism will be a harder sell outside New York.
Nonetheless, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old community organizer who has never held political office, is trying to leverage her fame to promote other progressive candidates -- many female, and almost all viewed, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was, as long shots. She has waded into races on the federal, statewide and local levels, with the same message: The time for discounting female and outsider candidates has passed.
Women in politics have long banded together to craft formal policy and to share informal tips. Emily's List, the influential national organization that works to elect Democratic women, runs a 5,000-member Facebook group for women who are seeking office, considering a bid or supporting other female candidates. Several of the candidates Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has embraced noted that their collaborations predated last Tuesday's primary.
But female candidates and veteran strategists agreed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's victory had lent fresh energy to -- and public recognition of -- a new collaborative model of politics, one that unfolds both in private group chats and on public Twitter posts, in which grass-roots candidates share everything from volunteer lists to tips for handling criticism of their physical appearance.
"What I've seen is a lot of activity on Twitter and Facebook of women saying, 'Hey, pay attention to these other women,"' Ms. Bush said. "We were doing it before, but after Tuesday, now it's like, 'Hey, no, pay attention, because this is for real. These women can win if we just get behind them."'
Ms. Teachout, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Cuomo in the 2014 Democratic primary, remembered the feeling of being snubbed by community leaders at the time, even though she would go on to win more than a third of the vote.
"There's this tradition of not taking outsider women seriously," said Ms. Teachout, who endorsed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in May. For those women now to support each other, she continued, is "to say, 'We're not going to allow that to happen anymore."'
The most visible manifestations of this support have unfolded on social media, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has also touted several other insurgent candidates, such as Kerri Harris, a Senate candidate in Delaware. But the cross-pollination has taken more logistical forms, too.
In the week before New York's primary, Ms. Salazar helped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez with get-out-the-vote efforts, as did an organizer for Ms. Pressley, who traveled from Boston to participate. Since the election, volunteers for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez (who is virtually guaranteed victory in November's general election in her predominantly Democratic district) have migrated to those of Ms. Teachout and Ms. Salazar; Ms. Teachout's aides, who previously coordinated volunteers via phone calls, have begun dispatching them through a group chat on WhatsApp, a tactic adopted from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's campaign.
Ms. Salazar, who like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, said she had heard from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's volunteers before their campaign was even over.
"There used to be a tendency to operate with this vision of scarcity, rather than a vision of abundance, when it comes to political capital," Ms. Salazar said. "I think that we see a shift."
[Read about Amy McGrath, who set her sites on the Marines and now Congress. Her mother is the reason.]
Our Revolution, the progressive organization led by alumni of Bernie Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, is planning to unroll a project, called Our Revolution(ary) Women. The effort is designed to help the female candidates in New York it has endorsed, including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Salazar and Ms. Nixon, amplify each other's platforms.
Rebecca Katz, an adviser to Ms. Nixon's campaign to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in New York, said such a spirit of partnership was previously unthinkable in the transactional world of politics.
"Do you know how long it takes for someone to send an email on your behalf?" said Ms. Katz, a veteran strategist who has worked for Mayor Bill de Blasio and the former Nevada senator, Harry Reid. "For women candidates, especially, that has been extremely hard. There's usually so much back and forth, back and forth, please, can I have an endorsement?"
Ms. Nixon had struggled to attract the endorsements of prominent elected officials. But since Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's win, she has secured the support of several, including the former New York City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, who cited Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in her announcement.
Kelly Dittmar, a professor at Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, said alliances among female politicians, while not unprecedented, appeared to have increased significantly in pace, profile and extent this election cycle. She attributed the change to technology, the proliferation of female candidates and the heightened attention they have attracted.
And while past collaborations had often focused on more intangible goods such as encouragement or ideas, "what goes a little bit further, which is the sharing of actual resources, in some ways, of the campaign -- that, I'm not aware of historically," Professor Dittmar said.
It is also uncertain if the nationwide excitement she has generated for candidates such as Ms. Nixon or Ms. Bush will energize the specific constituencies they need to elect them.
But with many of these female candidates facing challengers whose fund-raising dwarfs theirs, collaborating may be a product not just of camaraderie but also of necessity.
"They're folks that aren't necessarily endorsed by the party or don't have access to the party networks," Professor Dittmar said. "So in order to build that support base -- among voters, but especially in terms of finances and volunteers -- they have to build something new or at least draw from existing infrastructure for progressive candidates."
The ties among women's campaigns are far from limited to those in the radius of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's star power. Liuba Grechen Shirley, who won the Democratic nomination for a House seat on Long Island, said she had spoken to other candidates across the country, as well as women who said they were considering running because of the Federal Election Commission's landmark decision that she could use campaign funds for child care.
An informal cheering group has emerged among three female congressional candidates who all graduated from the Naval Academy: Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Amy McGrath of Kentucky, and Elaine Luria of Virginia have frequently exchanged encouraging Twitter posts.
"I trust them in ways that I just don't have the trust from regular politicians," Ms. McGrath said of her fellow Naval Academy graduates. "They aren't one, and I'm not one."
But most female candidates agreed that the most important outcome of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's victory was the legitimacy it lent to networks of women that many had previously dismissed.
"I do sense a huge difference now," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.
"I think when people see that we are using this bullhorn for something that's not self-interested," she added, "they're more likely to pay attention."

Ocasio-Cortez tweaks bio after scrutiny

Full text: U.S. congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's online biography was tweaked days after she faced scrutiny over where she grew up.
Ocasio-Cortez, 28, drew national attention when she won a Democratic primary against longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley in a district that represents parts of the Bronx and Queens.
Her bio was called into question by some conservatives after the victory because she lived and went to school in Westchester County, which some critics charged contradicted her Bronx-girl campaign narrative.
The bio previously stated, "She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx."
That sentence in the bio has since been changed, though it still doesn't explicitly state that she moved out of the Bronx to Yorktown when she was 5 years old.
"She ended up attending public school in Yorktown, 40 minutes north of her birthplace," it now states. "As a result, much of her early life was spent in transit between her tight-knit extended family in the Bronx & her daily student life."
Ocasio-Cortez was 2 when her father, Sergio Ocasio-Roman, bought a modest home in Yorktown for $150,000.
The family lived in the Parkchester section of the Bronx at the time and moved to the house in Yorktown a few years later.
Ocasio-Cortez graduated from Yorktown High School in 2007.
Her father died in September 2008, just as she was starting her sophomore year at Boston University. The house was deeded to her mother, the executor of her father's will, in 2012.
Westchester land records show that Ocasio-Cortez was living there with her mother and brother in 2016 when they sold the home for $355,000.
Ocasio-Cortez's win in the primary has been viewed as a possible shift in the party.
She won in a diverse district against an establishment candidate as a Democratic socialist in the mold of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, on whose 2016 presidential campaign she had worked.
She campaigned in favor of Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage, federal legalization of marijuana and abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office.
Her appearances since winning the primary on June 26 include a guest spot on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," where she answered a question about how she'd work with President Donald Trump, who was born in Queens.
"I don't think he knows how to deal with a girl from the Bronx," she said.
The Daily Mail brought up the residency issue in a story last Saturday and conservative media pounced. Newsmax's John Cardillo tweeted out a photo of the Yorktown home the family lived in and incorrectly stated she went on to attend Brown University.
She fired back about the error, telling him to "Try Google."
"Your attempt to strip me of my family, my story, my home, and my identity is exemplary of how scared you are of the power of all four of those things," she tweeted back.
The 14th Congressional District is largely Democratic, and she's considered the heavy favorite against Republican candidate Anthony Pappas, a St. John's University professor.
If she wins in November, she'll be the youngest woman to ever take office in Congress.

Political star takes heat for local ties

Full text: A rising political star who unseated a 10-term congressman in a Democratic Party primary last week is facing questions about whether she grew up in an urban Bronx neighborhood or on a quiet suburban street in Westchester County.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 28, who beat longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley in an upset victory last Tuesday, lived in Yorktown and went to Yorktown public schools — which some are saying doesn't jibe with her campaign narrative of being "a girl from the Bronx."
"The state of Bronx public schools in the late '80s and early '90s sent her parents on a search for a solution," the biography on her campaign website states. "She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx."
Ocasio-Cortez was 2 years old when her father, Sergio Ocasio-Roman, bought a modest home on Longvue Street in Yorktown for $150,000. The family lived in the Parkchester section of the Bronx at the time and moved to the house in Yorktown a few years later.
Ocasio-Cortez graduated from Yorktown High School in 2007.
Her father died in September 2008, just as she was starting her sophomore year at Boston University. The house was deeded to her mother, the executor of her father's will, in 2012.
Westchester County land records show that Ocasio-Cortez was living there with her mother and brother in 2016 when they sold the home for $355,000.
The candidate didn't return a call or email seeking comment. In a statement she gave to the Daily Mail.com last Tuesday, she said the story she has told through her campaign was consistent that she "grew up between two worlds."
She said her extended family chipped in for a down payment on the home and her father and extended family continued to live in the Bronx through her school years, according to the Daily Mail.
Her move to Yorktown was documented in a New York Times profile published after her victory last week, but her campaign bio's description of a commute was criticized for telling a different story.
"It was clear to her, even then, that the ZIP Code a child was born in determined much of their destiny," it states. "The 40-minute drive represented a vastly different quality of available schooling, economic opportunity and health outcomes."
Late night TV In an interview with Stephen Colbert on TV's "The Late Show," Ocasio-Cortez responded to a question about how she'd deal with President Donald Trump, who was born in Queens, by saying "I don't think he knows how to deal with a girl from the Bronx."
The Daily Mail called into question her Bronx bona fides in a story Saturday and, on Sunday, conservative talk-show host John Cardillo tweeted out a photo of the family home she grew up in Yorktown "before going off to Ivy League Brown University."
"A far cry from the Bronx hood upbringing she's selling," the tweet said.
Ocasio-Cortez fired back at Cardillo on Twitter, noting she went to Boston University and not Brown. She went on to say "it was a good town for working people."
"My mom scrubbed toilets so I could live here & I grew up seeing how the zip code one is born in determines much of their opportunity," the tweet stated.
It continued, "Your attempt to strip me of my family, my story, my home, and my identity is exemplary of how scared you are of the power of all four of those things."
Victory signals a shift Ocasio-Cortez's victory in the primary last week has been analyzed for possibly signifying a shift in the Democratic Party electorate. The candidate won in a diverse district despite a fundraising disadvantage and ran as a "Democratic socialist" in the mold of Sen. Bernie Sanders, on whose 2016 presidential campaign she had worked.
She'll face Queens resident Anthony Pappas, a St. John's University professor, in the general election in November, but she's considered all but a shoo-in.
Active registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 214,000-33,000 in the 14th Congressional District. Papas, reached by telephone, saw the residency discussion as much ado about nothing.
"If she wants to define herself as a girl from the Bronx and she's comfortable with that identity, I think she can say that's the case," he said. "You don't have to be exclusively in the Bronx every minute of your life. You know, the same thing applies to me, I could say I'm a lifelong New York resident, but I went away to college at MIT."

Full text: A rising political star who unseated a 10-term congressman in a Democratic Party primary last week is facing questions about whether she grew up in an urban Bronx neighborhood or on a quiet suburban street in Westchester County.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 28, who beat longtime U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley in an upset victory last Tuesday, lived in Yorktown and went to Yorktown public schools — which some are saying doesn't jibe with her campaign narrative of being "a girl from the Bronx."
"The state of Bronx public schools in the late '80s and early '90s sent her parents on a search for a solution," the biography on her campaign website states. "She ended up attending public school 40 minutes north in Yorktown, and much of her life was defined by the 40-minute commute between school and her family in the Bronx."
Ocasio-Cortez was 2 years old when her father, Sergio Ocasio-Roman, bought a modest home on Longvue Street in Yorktown for $150,000. The family lived in the Parkchester section of the Bronx at the time and moved to the house in Yorktown a few years later.
Ocasio-Cortez graduated from Yorktown High School in 2007.
Her father died in September 2008, just as she was starting her sophomore year at Boston University. The house was deeded to her mother, the executor of her father's will, in 2012.

‘This loss is on me’: Crowley tries to calm tensions in first interview since primary shocker

Full text: Rep. Joseph Crowley, the House Democratic Caucus chairman, took personal blame for his shocking primary loss last month and sought to defuse tensions within his party on Sunday in his first extended interview since the election.
"This loss is on me," said Crowley (N.Y.), who lost his bid for renomination for an 11th term on June 26 to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "I did not do as I preach. You know, I talk about all politics being local. I didn't remind folks of my accomplishments. I didn't talk about what I had done to help people in my district . . . I just took that for granted, I think."
Crowley spoke on CBS's "Face the Nation" three days after an unusual Twitter spat with Ocasio-Cortez made clear that hostilities had not yet ceased between the 56-year-old Queens party boss and the 28-year-old former bartender who embraced a left-wing platform and accused Crowley and national Democrats of not paying enough attention to the needs of minorities and the working class.
In a Thursday tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said Crowley had "stood me up" for scheduled concession calls and accused him of seeking to mount a third-party challenge to keep his seat in November.
Responding directly on Twitter, Crowley blamed Ocasio-Cortez's campaign for the failed calls and said "the race is over." His showing last month entitled Crowley to run as nominee of the Working Families Party, and vacating the party's line on the November ballot would entail either changing his address or accepting nomination for another office.
Though his family lives in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, Crowley said that he had no plans formally to move out of New York and that the latter would amount to "election fraud."
Crowley did not directly address the spat on Sunday but urged his critics to avoid "character assassination."
"What we really need to do is take that energy that's been focused in terms of internal bouts and focus that on Republicans and win seats that Republicans hold today if we really want to make a difference," he said. "I do think we need to focus now on winning seats in November and ensuring that Democrats are in control for the sake of our country, quite frankly."
While Crowley said he took personal responsibility for his loss, he pointed to factors that he said could explain it — running as a man in what he called a "year of the woman" and a new New York state election schedule that moved congressional primaries from early September to late June, putting them on a separate schedule from state and local races.
"But, you know, I don't think we can really go back and re-litigate that aspect of it," he said. "We're all playing by the same rules, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and I played by the same rules."
Host Margaret Brennan also asked Crowley whether House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ought to remain party leader in the next Congress. Crowley said that decision would be in the hands of the next Congress — but he suggested that she would have a hard time retaining power if Democrats do not retake the House majority.
"If we win the House back, Nancy will have a very strong case for holding on to the speakership," he said. "If not, then maybe other issues then come to the fore at that point."

Full text: President Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., trolled Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter Thursday, saying the insults she launched at the Republican Party were in fact truths about her own party.

The democratic socialist progressive Democrat had called conservatives "weak" on fighting for working class Americans, crime, equal rights, and national security, among other things.

"She’s getting Republicans and Democrats mixed up again. That’s twice this week," Trump wrote Thursday evening.

At a rally l L ast weekend, Ocasio-Cortez, a former bartender, mixed up the party colors and instead of saying "blue" for Democrats, she called for Kansas voters to flip a seat "red."

The 28-year-old Ocasio-Cortez upset incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., in a primary race last month and is expected to secure his seat in the election this November.

Americans actually like 'socialist' policies

Author: Cohen, Michael A

Publication info: Boston Globe (Online) ; Boston [Boston]27 July 2018.

http://libproxy.usc.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2077030351?accountid=14749

Full text: Last month, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year old political upstart and avowed socialist, upended a a powerful Democratic incumbent in a New York congressional primary, it helped return the word “socialism" to prominence in American political debates — though not necessarily in a good way.
Ocasio-Cortez quickly became a political punching bag for conservatives. Countless columns by conservatives and even moderate Democrats exorcised Ocasio-Cortez's dystopian vision of an America in which everyone has access to health care, affordable housing, a quality education, paid sick and family leave, and a living wage.
Indeed, many of the criticisms of Ocasio-Cortez's platform, which is not radical, not truly socialist, and is actually fairly popular, seems to boil down to that nasty nine-letter word, “socialism."
Case in point, the bizarre meltdown experienced by conservative commentator Meghan McCain on the talk show “The View," earlier this week.
McCain is no fan of socialism because . . . socialism is bad. Her proof is the country of Venezuela, which is experiencing a calamitous economic and social breakdown and has become a useful poster child for socialism-bashing conservatives. Never mind that many countries around the world have adopted the allegedly “socialist domestic policies" that Ocasio-Cortez is extolling — and have a citizenry that is happier, healthier, and more economically comfortable than in the United States. Socialism is bad. Period.
McCain cited two examples of the evils of big government socialism in America — the Post Office and the Veterans Administration. She could hardly found a stranger duo.
These are two of the most successful and well-run government institutions in America. When it comes to the former, I defer to Post Office evangelist Paul Waldman, a writer for The Washington Post and The American Prospect. The Post Office, he writes, “will come to your house, take a letter that you've written, move that letter by truck or plane or boat thousands of miles as far as it needs to go, and deliver it to the person you've sent it to, all in just a few days."
It delivers 149 billion pieces of mail a year, which is half the mail in the world. And how much does this extraordinary service that we all take for granted cost? Forty-nine cents.
If you wanted to build a mail service from scratch and keep prices as low as they are, it would be impossible — and certainly unprofitable. Only the government can do something like this.
What about the VA? In recent years, the agency has been buffeted by scandals, but in reality, it is one of the best-run health care systems in the country. According to a 2016 Rand Corporation study, the quality of care at the VA is “equal to or better than care delivered in the private sector."
The VA is ahead of the curve when it comes to use of electronic medical records, evidence-based medicine, and top-notch behavioral health programs.
Indeed, one of the strangest elements of the socialism debate revolves around health care. Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly, is one of the most popular government programs in the country (the only one more admired is another big government socialist initiative, Social Security). Beyond its popularity, Medicare is also more efficient than private health insurance.
How many Americans have warm and fuzzy feelings about their health insurance company? How about your cable company, your mobile provider, your airline, or your bank? How many Americans think these are well-run organizations, responsive to customer needs and highly efficient? One might even argue that government-run institutions, not burdened by the pursuit for profit, are better position to provide the most essential public services.
But for McCain, the issue with socialism is less about the provision of government services and more about the possibility that a larger role for government will mean higher taxes. Considering that McCain's family has a fortune of more than $200 million and just saw their taxes cut — including the estate tax, which will likely impact Meghan McCain — I understand her concerns.
And let's face it, for many Americans, just hearing the word socialism is like waving a red flag in front of a bull. But when you get past the loaded political rhetoric and look at the so-called socialist ideas being pushed by Ocasio-Cortez and other left-leaning Democrats, what you have are policies that are consistent with existing government programs that Americans actually like. If implemented, these policies might even bring enormous benefits to millions of Americans.
You don't have to be a card-carrying socialist to believe that access to health care, affordable housing, a quality education, sick leave, and family leave are net positives and that the government can often provide those services better than the private sector. You just need to believe in facts.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not your manic pixie dream girl

Full text: Earlier this month WNBA player Devereaux Peters penned an Outlook essay for The Post about how random men, aware of her success playing a sport for a living, routinely challenge her to one-on-one games of basketball. It's almost as though these men cannot accept that a women can be more talented, successful and publicly prominent than a man, in a space they view as their own.
Which brings us to never-Trump conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who earlier this week challenged New York congressional candidate and overnight media sensation Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to a debate.
That Ocasio-Cortez refused to debate Shapiro was not a surprise. It's how she did it that made news.
Just like catcalling, I don't owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions.

A bit of hyperbole? Absolutely. But Ocasio-Cortez's tweet gets to the heart of women's experiences, in both life and politics. Shapiro's challenge to her demonstrated how as a society we value — or more correctly, do not value — women's expertise, experience and time.
Let's review: Shapiro issued his challenge on Wednesday, saying he offered to pay $10,000 to Ocasio-Cortez's campaign (likely a campaign violation) or a charity if she agreed to come on his show and debate him. Ocasio-Cortez initially ignored Shapiro, but many on Twitter began to follow up, asking why she wasn't responding. Finally, Ocasio-Cortez succumbed to the online pressure, leading to the tweet above.
Let me be clear. Ocasio-Cortez did not need to address Shapiro at all. He is not her opponent in November. He's not even another politician. He's simply a public commentator, albeit a prominent one in conservative circles. Some have called him a troll.
I say this to point out that Shapiro, in issuing his challenge, didn't simply interject himself into Ocasio-Cortez's orbit. He screamed for her attention. This isn't even first time he's waved his hands in Ocasio-Cortez's face: Last month, he posted a satirical "interview" with Ocasio-Cortez, where reaction shots of Shapiro were edited in to an interview the congressional candidate had done with someone else. (It's worth noting that CRTV host Allie Stuckey pulled a similar stunt.)
Why would anyone expect Ocasio-Cortez to say yes? Shapiro is using Ocasio-Cortez as a way to get publicity for one person — Ben Shapiro. His political positions and hers are diametrically opposed, and his listeners aren't exactly undecided voters. A practiced debater, he wants to show up the less-seasoned Ocasio-Cortez. For Shapiro, Ocasio-Cortez is a nasty version of cinema's "manic pixie dream girl," the quirky female character who exists solely to push the male protagonist to take on life's challenges — in this case, by engaging in a cheap stunt to enhance a brand.
Shapiro claims he's just looking for "discussion and debate" with the woman that Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez called "the future of the Democratic Party." Two things: First, again, Shapiro's not a politician. Moreover, funnily enough, Shapiro hasn't spent weeks challenging someone like Bernie Sanders to a debate. Nor did his team go to the trouble to cut together a fake interview with Sanders. It's almost as though this isn't about ideas, but identity.
This unequal attention is something women are all too familiar with. Women are judged harshly for ambition, while men are judged for not possessing it. Men are called promising, while women are deemed inexperienced. Men are presumed to be experts, whereas women need to prove their expertise repeatedly. Mistakes by women are amplified, while those of men are brushed over. Women are supposed to be cooperative, while men can showboat all they want and not fear judgment. And we value women's time less than that of men: Of course Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should debate a conservative journalist! Surely she doesn't have anything better to do!
Catcallers are never trying to compliment their targets. They are rather attempting to remind them that the targets' ability to go about their business in public is forever subject to the catcallers' challenge. What Shapiro did to Ocasio-Cortez is something women who attempt to engage in the public space deal with all too often — just ask Nancy Pelosi.
True, Ocasio-Cortez took advantage of her sudden fame after her surprise victory over Rep. Joseph Crowley in a New York Democratic primary, going on television news shows, giving interviews, and endorsing other candidates, even taking a widely covered tour with Bernie Sanders. And true, Ocasio Cortez, a 28-year-old political rookie, has stumbled more than once. But as Nate Silver pointed out, these sorts of mistakes don't make Ocasio-Cortez any less informed than more than the average member of Congress. Many have said much worse. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), for example, has compared giving hormones to transgender members of the military to castration and claimed Muslims should not work at meatpacking plants because they want others eating to be "sent to hell."
So, a bit of advice. It's August; things are slowing down. Ocasio-Cortez should buckle down and do her policy homework, so she can come back strong in September. As for Shapiro, if he wants to debate political candidates, he should run for office. He apparently believes he's qualified to do so. Let's see what he's got.

Full text: Washington (JTA) – Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro challenged Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the tyro socialist Democrat from the Bronx, to a debate on Wednesday.
Things quickly devolved into off-topic discussions of sexual harassment and Orthodox Judaism, with Monica Lewinsky making a cameo appearance.
Hey, @Ocasio2018, what do you say? pic.twitter.com/lKDtmMc8Us
— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 8, 2018
Shapiro offered $10,000 to a charity of Ocasio-Cortez’s choice or to her campaign if she took him up on his offer. He said the congressional candidate had accused Republicans of being afraid to debate, and here he was ready to debate.
Shapiro’s challenge spurred a lot of “fight, fight, fight” from conservative Twitter, compiled here on the conservative website Twitchy.
(I could not, in a quick internet dive, come up with instances of Ocasio-Cortez decrying Republican cowardice. I did find an account of her debate strategy in The New Yorker, in an article about her successful primary unseating of veteran Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley. She kept showing up for debates. He bailed twice, and the one time he showed up, she whomped him, at least according to the admiring David Remnick.)
If there were a debate, you could probably count on Shapiro, a prominent Israel defender, to challenge Ocasio-Cortez on her harsh criticism of Israel. She described the day in May when Israeli troops killed more than 60 Palestinians, mostly Hamasniks, attempting to breach the fence with the Gaza Strip as a “massacre.”
Ocasio-Cortez did not have to reply: No one expects a candidate to debate non-candidates, and her from-the-left appeal is based much more on getting out the vote than it is on persuading undecided independents or hostile conservatives.
But reply she did on Thursday, and in the process advanced a jarring simile: Shapiro’s very polite debate challenge, she said, was akin to catcalling.
“Just like catcalling, I don’t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions,” she tweeted.

That prompted a new round of conservative outrage, accusing Ocasio-Cortez of playing the gender card.
“Crying sexism in order to avoid a debate of ideas is not a feminism I want any part of,” said Erielle Davidson, a contributor to The Federalist and TownHall.

John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, seized on Ocasio-Cortez’s claim that Shapiro’s challenge was based on “bad intentions.”
What bad intentions? A serious discussion that raises money for charity? This is just embarrassing. https://t.co/EfYdiDWSLm
— John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) August 10, 2018
And then it was Shapiro’s turn to get weird: He advanced his Orthodox Judaism as a defense against intimations that he was harassing her, when “challenging you to a debate is not harassment” would have worked just fine.
But sure, go with “the Orthodox Jew who has never catcalled a woman in his life is ACKSHUALLY a sexist catcaller for asking for a discussion or debate.” I’m sure your media sycophants will eat it up.
— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) August 10, 2018
A Shapiro defender, fellow conservative pundit Daniella Greenbaum, said Shapiro is “a happily married man,” implying presumably that no happily married man (like no Orthodox man) has ever made a rude sexual remark to a woman.
And frankly, this comparison is offensive. @benshapiro is a happily married man. Catcalling involves hitting on someone. He’s invited you to…. a debate. This isn’t complicated
— Daniella Greenbaum (@DGreenbaum) August 10, 2018
Carol Costello, an anchor on CNN’s Headline News Network, had enough. Quoting Shapiro’s “but I’m Orthodox” tweet thread, she admonished, “Sigh. Seriously Ben this is a silly stunt.” (Costello hosted Shapiro for a friendly and sympathetic interview when leftist protesters tried to drive him away from a lecture last year at the University of California, Berkeley.)
Lewinsky, who knows from trouble and male attention, weighed in by calling Ocasio-Cortez a “badass.”

Ocasio-Cortez Is Criticized For Media Ban

Full text: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic candidate for Congress who quickly became a star of progressive politics after winning an upset victory in a New York House primary this summer, came under fire this week for excluding the press from two community meetings that were otherwise open to the public.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who is predicted to win the 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of Queens and the Bronx, did not allow reporters to attend town hall meetings with residents on Aug. 8 and Aug. 12, The Queens Chronicle, a local weekly newspaper, reported Thursday.
By Friday, the decision had become a flash point for arguments over politics and press freedom. Some journalists pushed back on Twitter and advocated open access to public events -- one scoffed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a political newcomer, would be in for a rough time on Capitol Hill, where reporters roam freely. Others on social media made comparisons with President Trump's claim that the media is the "enemy of the people" and argued over what constitutes a public or private event.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called the controversy a "nonstory."
In tweets on Friday, she said that her community includes immigrants, victims of domestic violence and people with medical concerns. She said the two meetings were designed to help residents "feel safe discussing sensitive issues in a threatening political time."
She said future events would be open to the news media.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, a democratic socialist, rocketed to political stardom in June after defeating the Democratic incumbent, Representative Joseph Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House. A former organizer for Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign, she won on a progressive message that it was time for generational, racial and ideological change.
She is expected to have little difficulty defeating the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in a predominantly Democratic district that takes in working-class, immigrant-heavy swaths of the Bronx and Queens in November.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has recently taken her message to other parts of the country, promoting other progressive candidates and at times campaigning with Mr. Sanders. The article in The Queens Chronicle criticized her for banning the press during local events after a national public relations tour.
Her communications director, Corbin Trent, told The Washington Post that the campaign had done at least two dozen events with the news media in attendance since the primary, as well as 30 to 40 one-on-one interviews. "We've been very open and accessible to the press, and will continue to be so," he said.
Another campaign spokesman, Saikat Chakrabarti, said in an email on Friday night that the town hall meetings to which the news media were not invited were "wildly successful" in creating an inviting atmosphere to the community.
"We've heard overwhelmingly positive feedback from the hundreds of attendees since the event, and so we believe we succeeded in doing what we set out to do," Mr. Chakrabarti said, adding, "Feel free to reach back out when you want to report on real issues affecting the lives of Americans."

Full text: Last week, Ben Shapiro, the right-wing pundit, elicited outrage on his behalf from conservatives when he asked the Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to debate him and she said that she did not owe a response "to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions."
Mr. Shapiro had offered an hour of his time, $10,000 that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez could keep for her campaign or give to charity, and the opportunity, as he put it in a taped request, to make "America a more civil and interesting place."
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her admirers doubted the sincerity of someone who on his website, The Daily Wire, once posted a video cartoon characterizing Native Americans as murderous savages until Christopher Columbus arrived to enlighten them. (He later apologized.) Mr. Shapiro and his followers saw in her refusal further proof of the left's antipathy to engaging with ideological difference.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of course, is under no obligation to debate someone who is not running for anything. She does find herself, however, in the comparatively unusual position of igniting the interests of men who want to argue with her, whatever their motives.
It has not always been this way. When a victory over Joseph Crowley, the 10-term congressman she challenged in the Democratic primary seemed so improbable, he did not rush to join her on stage and argue about housing policy. The two candidates debated twice; on two other occasions Mr. Crowley said he could not attend because of scheduling conflicts, and on one of those he sent a surrogate, Annabel Palma, a former City Councilwoman, which left the impression that the girls ought to just work things out among themselves.
Feminism's grand resurgence this past year -- striking in the results of the Democratic primary in Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District on Tuesday in which Ilhan Omar, a young Somali immigrant, won in a six-way race that had three male candidates cumulatively receiving less than 9 percent of the vote -- seems to have had little effect on heightening the sensitivities of male politicians to the optics of dismissing their female opponents. When women in politics are not facing the tediousness of having men explain things to them, they are often up against the indignities of their apathy.
Debates in particular have long wielded a special power to trigger male condescension. During the first with a female candidate to be televised nationally -- the 1984 vice-presidential debate between George H.W. Bush and Geraldine Ferraro -- Americans bore witness to Mr. Bush patronizing a prominent congresswoman, who served as the secretary of the House Democratic Caucus, on the subject of foreign policy. ("Let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro," he said, "between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.")
Before Donald Trump stalked Hillary Clinton on stage, commandeering the frame in one of the 2016 presidential debates, Barack Obama had derided her as "likable enough," in a primary debate eight years earlier.
Not showing up at all amounts to another expression of entitlement, and when men are the ones not showing up, the implications easily become gendered. In 2014, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor challenging Andrew M. Cuomo in the Democratic primary for governor in New York, hoped to stand next to him and talk about corruption in Albany, Wall Street influence, money in politics, education funding -- but he refused, saying, at one point, that he had participated in many debates over the course of his career and that he found some to be "a disservice to democracy." Later, in the general election, Mr. Cuomo debated his Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, and two other men running on alternate party lines.
As it happened, Peter King, the longtime Republican congressman from Long Island, borrowed the governor's logic last year, when Liuba Grechen Shirley, a Democrat now challenging him for a seat he has held for 13 terms, invited him to participate in a town hall about Donald Trump's nascent presidency. Town halls, he said, wind up becoming "screaming matches" that "diminish" democracy.
The indifference only fueled her resentment and propelled her to run. There are few things that can spark both rage and agency among women quite like being ignored.
The Grechen Shirley campaign maintains that it has asked Mr. King to participate in five debates and that he has only agreed to one; he denies this. So far one debate is scheduled.
And yet indication that he may be taking his challenger more seriously was supplied in a Facebook update he posted on Tuesday, one day before her campaign released its first ad, a short film shot in Ms. Grechen Shirley's home in which she talks about the difficulties of life as a working mother. Representative King announced to his followers that he was collaborating with Ivanka Trump and other members of Congress on the issue of paid parental leave.
Several years ago he voted against the benefit for federal employees. "Changing economic realities now often require both spouses to be working," he wrote, as if newly awakened to that idea.
Often incumbents will try to forestall debates with opponents who are new to the political scene for fear of advancing their celebrity but Governor Cuomo has been slow to debate his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, even though she is already famous. In July, the governor skipped a forum in Westchester with 700 people, and Ms. Nixon sat next to an empty chair. Her campaign had been counting the days since it had first tried to schedule a debate with the governor, and Wednesday would have been the 100th day.
Then, on Day 98, the Cuomo campaign accepted an invitation from the CBS affiliate in New York to debate Ms. Nixon at Hofstra University on Aug. 29, a few days before the Labor Day weekend, when most of New York will be paddleboarding. The Nixon campaign has said that the terms of the debate were presented to it as a fait accompli.
"We understand this isn't a level playing field," a spokeswoman offered in a statement. "It hasn't been since the very beginning. Nothing is easy when you're an outsider, and it's even harder when you're a woman."
Regardless, Ms. Nixon will be there.

Political designs: How Beto’s basic black and white and Ocasio-Cortez’s revolutionary look defined their candidacies

Full text: Good day Austin:
Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who at the end of June won a Democratic primary for a congressional seat in New York City against one of the most powerful politicians in the city, soaring into the national political consciousness, have a few things in common.

The story of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (@Ocasio2018) rise to victory, in photos. https://t.co/gIlDNawtcT
— VICE (@VICE) June 28, 2018

Both project an upbeat, youthful vigor — or, more properly vigah, because O’Rourke is a virtual Kennedy and Ocasio-Cortez cut her political teeth working as an intern in U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy’s office while going to school at Boston University.
Of course Ocasio-Cortez is very young — at 28, a generation younger than the 45-year–old O’Rourke (she’s a Millennial, he’s Generation X).
Both also are masters of political virality, not to be mistaken for political virility, though maybe they are, these days, one and the same.

From n+1 magazine on June 30:
The democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s shocking victory in this week’s Democratic primary in New York’s 14th congressional district has rightly provoked enthusiastic commentary and analysis. If she beats her Republican opponent in November, as seems assured, Ocasio-Cortez will be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Her grassroots campaign against the business-friendly incumbent Joe Crowley, who until Tuesday was a likely candidate for speaker of the House, sends a significant signal to the Democratic Party. Ocasio-Cortez’s election to Congress would be the clearest sign yet of the electoral viability of the left in the US.
Her campaign also marks a major step forward for graphic design in American politics. Rather than the tired repetition of white letters on blue backgrounds, white letters on red backgrounds, and American flag iconography, energetic diagonals cut across Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign materials in an unexpected yellow and purple. When paired with the instantly iconic photo of the candidate by Jesse Korman, the vibrancy of the system is infectious.
And from Didi Martinez at Politico on July 7:
One of the year’s most distinctive, break-the-mold campaign designs belongs to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the giant-killing New York progressive who recently pulled off the upset of the primary season by defeating veteran Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley.
Using purples and yellows and drawing inspiration from old United Farm Workers of America posters, Ocasio-Cortez’s logo and campaign signs are a dramatic departure from customary practice.
Scott Starrett, who oversaw the creation of Ocasio-Cortez’s posters — which embraced Spanish-inspired inverted exclamation marks to highlight her Puerto Rican heritage — said they could afford to take design risks as they reached for a “bold, revolutionary look” for the campaign.
From Aileen Kwun at Fast Company on June 29:
Opting for bold lettering and a flat design treatment that forgoes drop shadows, gradients, American flag motifs, and other visual cliches, the identity intentionally avoids pretentious signifiers to refreshing effect; one might even liken the energetic campaign visuals to a local poster bill. In place of red, white, and blue, Ocasio-Cortez’s color scheme draws upon purple–a symbolic blend of the two-party system’s red and blue, also used by Brand New Congress–and yellow, as its aesthetic complement.
Enlarged, all-caps text–set bilingually in English and Spanish, in equal weighting–frames Ocasio-Cortez’s countenance with similarly angular effect, and her name, proudly flouted with inverted exclamation marks and stars, is emphatically, unapologetically multicultural. It’s an outward display of Ocasio-Cortez’s roots as a third-generation, working-class Bronxite with Puerto Rican heritage.
O’Rourke’s design went the other direction — no photo, no color, just BETO i n black and white, in keeping with his stripped-down punk sensibility and perhaps also in subliminal homage to a particular Texas comfort zone – Whataburger.
As the Fort Worth Star-Telegram’s Anna Tinsley wrote on Aug. 9:
What’s black and white and reminds some people of a tasty Texas treat?
Apparently it’s the campaign signs and logo being used by U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat embroiled in a battle with Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz for the Senate.
Some are taking to social media to say those campaign messages remind them of the design on the Whataburger spicy ketchup container.
On Sunday, I wrote a story about following O’Rourke on a three-day swing through South Texas the previous weekend.
The last rally was in Brownsville, emceed by the local state Rep. Eddie Lucio III.
From the story:
Was O’Rourke getting a late start in the Rio Grande Valley?
“I don’t think so,” Lucio said. “You’ve got to peak at the right time. You’ve got to conserve your energy. It’s a marathon, not a sprint, and I think he’s peaking and moving and gaining speed right when he needs to.”
But O’Rourke, 17 months into a relentless Senate campaign that has already taken him to all 254 Texas counties, is running the marathon as a sprint. Last weekend’s stops in Laredo, McAllen and Brownsville, drawing raucous crowds amid the campaign’s fecund fundraising and with poll after poll showing a competitive race — combined with his uncanny ability to draw national attention with viral video clips, most recently showing him skateboarding in a Brownsville Whataburger parking lot and another in which he explained his support for professional football players kneeling for the national anthem — suggested a campaign on a roll.
Following a candidate on the campaign trail is a time-honored way of reporting on politics. There were several other reporters following O’Rourke on his border swing.
It is, in fact, the next best thing to not being there if you are interested in what really matters — which is what’s going on on social media — Facebook, Twitter, likes, retweets, clicks, etc. The demands of the road can only distract from a disciplined attention to these coordinates.
Case in point, this viral tweet from Josh Billinson, the editor of the Independent Journal Review and a very talented tweeter, based in Washington, D.C., who I don’t believe was in Texas at all, but rather was, I assume, observing O’Rourke via his campaign’s Facebook live stream of virtually everything he does on the road.

Up until Billinson’s tweet, I thought I had a pretty good handle on the skateboarding story, if that’s what this was.
I had asked O’Rourke about his newly acquired board as he clutched it at a gaggle with reporters between his Saturday evening rally in Brownsville and his dinner at a Brownsville Whataburger with some 32 El Pasoans who had come by bus to Brownsville with Veronica Escobar, the Democratic candidate to replace O’Rourke representing El Paso in Congress, to help rally support for their hometown hero.

— jonathantilove (@JTiloveTX) August 19, 2018

O’Rourke was in a punk band — Foss — as a young man and I asked about his skateboarding background.
O’Rourke:
My dad bought me a skateboard when I was in the sixth grade for my birthday, so I must have turned 12. I met the guy who sold my dad that skateboard. He now lives in San Antonio. So I skated in elementary and little bit in high school and then my kids have a skateboard and I’ll jump on that. They have a long board. This is the opposite of a long board but it’s got these nylon wheels, really good wheels.
Filling out the profile of a punk skateboarder, I asked O’Rourke if there was any graffiti he wanted to cop to . Beto would be a great tag, after all, and I’m sure the Cruz campaign is scouring freight trains and overpasses in and around El Paso for incriminating evidence.
O’Rourke: No, no, no, no, no.
I didn’t follow O’Rourke to the Whataburger that night because, while I heard the El Paso crew was headed there, I didn’t know he would be joining them — though I should have assumed he would be. And frankly, I had a Whataburger for dinner the previous evening while waiting to get a new tire in San Antonio to replace one of the two new tires I had purchased the previous day in Austin that went flat on my way from an afternoon O’Rourke rally in San Antonio, to one that evening in Laredo.
Worse still, in order to get the quarters needed to turn on the air to see if I could revive the flat tire at the gas station where I had pulled over about 20 minutes outside San Antonio, I had to make a purchase, so I grabbed the first thing at hand, an orange package of Trident gum, though I don’t generally chew gum. But as the tire hissed air as quickly as I added it, and without a full-sized spare, I called AAA for a tow, sought comfort in my pack of orange Trident, and began chewing, quickly dislodging a crown.
I shoved the crown back where it belonged — where it remains to this day — got the tow to San Antonio, and while I waited for a new tire I repaired to a close-by Whataburger to do some research.
From Tinsley’s story on the resemblance between the Beto logo and the Whataburger spicy ketchup package:
Cruz’s campaign responded to the likeness.
“Unlike the spicy ketchup, when Texans unwrap the O’Rourke packaging, they are definitely not going to like what they see underneath,” Cruz campaign spokeswoman Emily Miller said. “He’s like a Triple Meat Whataburger liberal who is out of touch with Texas values.”
This was apparently not a good riposte.

The Cruz campaign said the Beto was a Triple Meat Whataburger liberal. For an old Texan like me that's a confusing metaphor. Anybody who can eat a Triple Meat Whataburger is no whimpy liberal. He's a beast in my book.

What Could Ted Cruz’s Campaign Mean When it Called Beto O’Rourke a “Triple Meat Whataburger Liberal”?, via Texas Monthly https://t.co/eE1hla8Iq6 https://t.co/aJo7cu9SIf pic.twitter.com/2f2EMiri5j
— MyMove101 (@MMove101) August 9, 2018

I confess in the my five-plus years in Texas I have only had a couple of Whataburgers, all via drive-through. The experience was fine but not life-altering, though I acknowledge and admire the fierce devotion of Texans to the chain. Like for HEB, only that one I actually live and feel.
In any case, unaccustomed to being inside a Whataburger, I looked around for the spicy ketchup package, and before I ordered my basic burger, I asked the guy at the counter how to secure a spicy ketchup in the Beto-like container. He looked at me as a bit of a security risk. I didn’t realize that a young woman would come around, when I received my order, with a condiment tray, like a cigarette girl in a 1940s nightclub.
Very classy.
The burger was pretty good. A single meat Whataburger was hefty. I doubted a triple-meat Whataburger was ever a good idea. And, at first glance, the resemblance between the ketchup package design and the Beto logo didn’t seem to me to be all that extraordinary.
But let us pause here to consider Ocasio-Cortez’s eye-catching design and how, there but for a former Austinite’s search for an acceptable taco in New York City, it might never have come off the way it did.
From that n+1 piece:
We were curious about how such a complex and impressive visual schema emerged, so we sought out the designers responsible for it: Scott Starrett, cofounder of Tandem (along with Shaun Gillen), and Maria Arenas, lead designer on the campaign. (Tandem’s Carlos Dominguez also assisted the campaign.) We spoke by phone on Friday, June 29, three days after Ocasio Cortez’s victory.
—Rachel Ossip and Mark Krotov
MARK KROTOV I first saw your campaign poster months ago, in a storefront on Queens Boulevard, in Sunnyside. At first I wasn’t sure if I was even looking at a campaign poster, but whatever it was, I knew I’d never seen anything quite like it. That poster was the first I’d heard of Ocasio-Cortez, and she more or less had my vote right at that moment. I was trying to remember when it was that I had that first encounter, and it feels like a long time ago—long before the articles began to be written. How did the process of working with Ocasio-Cortez and her campaign begin?
SCOTT STARRETT We’ve known Sandy [Ocasio-Cortez] for some time. We started talking politics before she began her bid for Congress—we even lent her our GoPro when she went to Standing Rock. But the seed of the campaign identity came from the fact that our whole studio really loves Sandy. That was a big part of why the design turned out so well.
MARIA ARENAS We really knew Sandy well, and we knew we had her complete trust. She trusted us to represent the campaign authentically.
RACHEL OSSIP How did the identity for the campaign evolve?
SS We’re in a revolutionary moment, so we went straight to the history of grassroots, civil rights, and social justice movements in search of a common language we could participate in. One that Sandy could participate in and that she belongs in. The most inspiring figures to us were Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, the cofounders of the National Farmworkers Association. They had a positive, uplifting message about bringing power to the people. It resonated so deeply with who Sandy the person was, and who Sandy the candidate became, that it was a good fit.
We also researched revolutionary posters, union badges, et cetera. But the National Farmworkers Association inspired us a great deal. We looked to a lot of low-fidelity activist materials bred from necessity, and we knew we couldn’t have too much polish. We wanted the identity to have a populist look, in the sense that it was simple enough that it could have been cut out of construction paper or made by hand in some way. But it also had to have a modern bent, with a nod to the visual culture of subway posters.
I’ve worked in politics for years. I had my first political clients in Austin almost seven years ago. The cultural and visual language there is so different. Had we run Ocasio’s identity in Texas, I don’t think it would have resonated to the same extent. In the Bronx and Queens, people speak and understand a different visual language. So when they saw it—and when you yourself saw it, Mark—they and you recognized that it kind of spoke to the visual language of New York and New York street advertising. People are advertised to differently in the subways than they are in, say, the Midwest or Texas.
Aha. Austin. I spoke to Scott Starrett back in early July.
Starrett, 34, moved to Austin from Lawrence, Kansas, where he was the director of marketing for the University of Kansas, when he was 27. He was hired by Katie Naranjo at GNI Communications where his clients included state Sen. Kirk Watson, Mayor Steve Adler and Hugh Fitzsimons, who finished out of the money in a three-way race against Jim Hogan and Kinky Friedman for the Democratic nomination for agriculture commissioner four years ago. Despite that fact that Starrett did this beautiful map of Texas for his campaign.
Fitzsimons campaign effectively ended the day he filed his paperwork to be on the ballot.
Starrett: It meant a lot to him, it was meaningful and he asked he go in alone to put his name on the ballot because it was sentimental. He put his name on the ballot as Hugh Asa Fitzsimons III. He came out and showed us that and we were all like, “What have you done to us?”
Starrett subsequently moved to New York and co-founded Tandem.
I asked him about his comment that he didn’t think the Ocasio-Cortez design would have worked in Texas.
STARRETT : New Yorkers “are exposed to so much in their visual culture that — I don’t want to use the word sophistication, because that’s condescending to you guys — but (in New York) you are bombarded by the different visual languages and meeting that visual culture halfway we found to be a really positive thing and it may have been too much for Texas, and that also sounds condescending.
The Ocasio-Cortez design, he said, “borders on sentimental and dramatic, right? Like the ethos is excessive on some level and Sandy’s a bombastic candidate. She’s a firebrand, so when you hear her talk, you instantly go, ‘Oh, Ok, the poster fits, so it works.'”
“It might have been a little high-falutin’ for Texas.”
Originally, he said, the campaign “wanted a ton of inspirational text packed on there and we tried and we tried and at first we said, `I don’t think it’s going to work, it just doesn’t work, it was overbearing.’ They said, `Make it work.'”
“Some campaigns force you to do things that won’t work,” he said. But, ultimately the Ocasio-Cortez campaign relented.
Why?
“Not only was Sandy our friend, but she trusted us and believed in us.”
And they came up with a selection of buttons that each emphasized an issue.
Starrett and his partner became friends with Sandy because of Starrett’s yearning for tacos like the ones he’d grown to love in Austin.
“Oh man, I miss all the tacos, but Pueblo Viejo, that was my taco lunch,” said Starrett of the taco truck in the parking lot next to the GNI office on Brushy Street (it’s since moved inside the North Door).
(Note that the Pueblo Viejo color palette is to the Ocasio-Cortez campaign what the Whataburger spicy ketchup black and white is to O’Rourke’s look.)
STARRETT: New York does not always have the best tacos. Our office is in Union Square. So I was roaming around looking for something to eat and this new restaurant had just opened. I think I walked in on the second day and, I said, `OK, this could work out. You know there’s a taco joint less than a block from our office. This is a good thing. I could see good things happening for us.
“It’s called Flats Fix. It’s attached to the Coffee Shop,” a Union Square institution known as a hangout for models, he said.
It turned out that the bartender/waitress at Flats Fix was Ocasio-Cortez.
As she explains in a clip from Knock Down the House — a documentary being made about four women candidates for Congress, including Ocasio-Crotez — “I started waitressing after the financial crisis because we were about to lose our house.”
STARRETT: We’re fairly down-to-earth people. Over time my business partner, Shaun Gillen, and I, we gravitated solely toward lunching and having business meetings at Flats Fix.
We’re pretty much always talking business so we made friends with the staff and they could see we were up to something and so that, along with politics — everyone in New York was talking politics in 2016 leading up to the race — so we really hit it off being politically inclined folks and when Sandy went to Standing Rock and she went to Detroit (Flint), we let her borrow our office studio’s GoPro to help document her trip and then later, as things started heating up, she got me in touch with … and we started working for Brand New Congress and justice Democrats (both groups supporting Ocasio-Cortez’s candidacy) and then I let her borrow my car to drive upstate to attend endorsement meetings.
She calls us out on Twitter as her Day One Brothers – is what she calls us. So we were there from the start just encouraging her, telling her we thought she had it in her, just encouraging her every step of the way.
She is fierce now in a way that I think has impressed and surprised all of us but she’s always been gregarious and intellectual and kind.
Starrett said she worked at Flats Fix until about 10 months ago. (Her image, working the bar, continued to adorn the Flats Fix website after her election, but is now gone.)
She apparently previously worked at the Coffee Shop, which had a different clientele but the same ownership.
“The owners are clearly not fans of her politics — they are wealthy and they want to keep as much of their wealth as they can,” said Starrett. And, indeed, since our conversation they announced they are closing the Coffee Shop, blaming increases in the minimum wage, though they are keeping Flats Fix open.
Before heading down to South Texas, I spoke with Tony Casas in El Paso who designed the Beto logo.
Casas is a partner and part owner of Stanton Street, a web design and development company and digital marketing firm founded and formerly owned by O’Rourke, who hired Casas as a junior designer in 2008. O’Rourke turned the firm over his wife, Amy, when he was elected to Congress, and she in turn sold it just before O’Rourke announced for the Senate to Casas and Brian Wancho, the president and CEO.
“ He really took a chance on me and I’m glad that it worked out,” Casas said of O’Rourke.
I told him what Starrett said about the Ocasio-Cortez campaign being too bold a look for Texas. I wondered whether the O’Rourke campaigns choice of black and white confirmed that assessment.
Casas said that what guided O’Rourke to like the spare black and white design was his punk sensibility.
“Beto was real big on black and white to begin with,” Casas said. “It goes back to his punk rock roots, which are very black and white.”
Cases who, at 36, is a decade younger than O’Rourke, also grew up in the El Paso punk scene, designing posters and flyers for groups appearing locally.
CASAS: A lot of his campaign is based off of transparency and honesty and being straightforward about who he is and no sham about that, and the black and white more appealed to that and I think he just identified more with the black and white than the color, and it was less about what Texas was going to think.
He didn’t want the smoke and mirrors that everybody else has. He wanted it to be as bold and straightforward as he possibly could.
“I am punk rock at heart too so I knew about his band,” Casas said.
Had he ever seen him perform?
“I’m pretty sure I have, I know I’ve seen him on fliers,” Casas said. ” I did all the punk rock posters for bands after he was already out of the scene but I’m almost positive that I have (seen him) but I just don’t recall off-hand because it wasn’t as significant as it would become — who would ever have thought.”
Casas also designed the retro RFK Beto buttons in a more traditional red, white and blue.
CASAS: That was mine. A lot of people kept on making that comparison early that he looked a lot like Robert Kennedy and we were talking about it and I’m, “That’s an awesome statement for people to make the comparison.” I was, “we’re already working on some retro designs, let’s play off that,” and we created those buttons and passed them out during the launch.
Casas said the punk palette is black, white and bright pink.
I asked where the pink was and he said Veronica Escobar, the Democrat running for Beto’s seat, was using it in her campaign, which is being designed by another El Paso outfit.
Having said all that, Casas’ original design for the Beto logo was in color, and that’s what he presented to O’Rourke and the campaign team. But, because it didn’t feel quite right to him, he had also prepared a black-and-white version that was not part of the presentation.
CASAS: They didn’t hate them but at the same they had the same feeling, they’re good but, uh, oh i don’t know. I said, “Let me show you one other thing. I made the same logo in black and white. Let me know what you guys think.” And the second I showed it to them, Beto was the first, “That’s it, that’s what I’m going for,” and everyone else was, “Yeah, that’s more or less what we wanted,” and then we tweaked it until we got it right.
His whole campaign has been, “This is me and this is what I’m doing, transparency and honesty and what better way to do that than simple black-and-white signs saying Beto’s running for Senate.”
Casas said it’s the black and white that most draws comparison to the Whataburger spicy ketchup package. That and the lines on either side of Spicy, on the ketchup lid, and For Senate on the Beto logo.
CASAS: At one time the lines from the E were extended all the way through to the end of the logo and that looked weird to me, so I cut the lines off and left them there, and then centered the “For Senate”, and then added the lines to the other side. so those lines are just the extension of the E and then when I did that it was, OK, it looks symmetrical, it looks a lot better like that.

When he showed the final version to O’Rourke, Casas said, “I was talking to people in the office and it hit me, you know this feels very Whataburger, but at the same time, the consensus was, that could work, you know, it’s OK. It’s not like we copied it, but I mean it could work. It’s Texas. People love Whataburger and I’m included, and one of the funniest things, the very first time I sat down to talk to Beto about the logo, I kid you not, the entire campaign was there (in the campaign office) eating Whataburgers, and I think back to that now, and it was a sign from the beginning.”
After he finished the final design, Casas said, “I didn’t want to look at it.”
CASAS: I knew this was potentially going to get national attention and I didn’t want to read the comments. I know what the comments are like on social media and I don’t want to be a part of it. I know how mean social media can be. Up until maybe the last week I have never felt proud of it, not because it wasn’t good but just because I was scared. Now that people are embracing him and embracing it and sticking up for a logo they had nothing to do with, it’s empowering. It feels great.
Not leaving well enough alone, I asked Casas the ultimate question — is Whataburger objectively good or just a home state favorite.
CASAS: I don’t know. Whataburger is always just a thing for us. My wife and I have been friends since we were 13 years old and her loyalties are always Whataburger. She says, “I like the taste more than anything.” She orders a plain Whataburger, no cheese, no nothing on it, just a burger and bun and she says it has the best meat of anybody.
Either we were raised to like it or it’s plain good.
Indeed, Casas recalls how his father, who used to work at Wendy’s, would bring Whataburger home for the family.
Which brings us to the 1984 Democratic presidential campaign and the popular Wendy’s ad that Walter Mondale used to truly devastating effect against Gary Hart, when it appeared Hart had Mondale, who had seemed a prohibitive front-runner, on the ropes.
Four years later, New York Times political correspondent R.W. Apple wrote that, “Walter F. Mondale’s memorable ‘`Where’s the beef?” response to Gary Hart’s ‘new ideas’ … may have enabled the former Vice President to wrest the Democratic presidential nomination from Mr. Hart in a very close race.”
Now, 34 years later, comes a Cruz spokesman suggesting that O’Rourke has too much beef, albeit of the liberal variety, with O’Rourke and company offering a playful reminder of the miscue by ordering triple meat Whataburgers in Brownsville after O’Rourke worked up an appetite with a block walk in Laredo, town halls in McAllen and Brownsville, and the quick skate seen ’round the world in the Whataburger parking lot.
I stayed at the same hotel that night as O’Rourke and the next morning saw him in the breakfast area.
I quickly recounted for him my conversation with Casas and my earlier conversation with Starrett about Ocasio-Cortez’s design.
I asked if he had met Ocasio-Cortez and he said he hadn’t. I said I thought she had been at the Father’s Day march he led on the immigration detention center in Tornillo to protest the separation of families at the border, but it turned out she was there a week later on the eve of her primary.

“I would love to meet her and I should probably get her phone number and just reach out to her and talk to her,” O’Rourke said. “I am just really impressed, not just by her victory, but she is on the march. How old is she? 32? Is she that old?”
I asked about Casas and the decision to go back and white with the Beto logo.
“I just remember having a conversation with him — I don’t want flags, I don’t flames of liberty,” O’Rourke said.
“I don’t want the stuff you see all the time in logos. Just make it as plain as you can, and then I remember, he was showing us the color version and I said, `Just black and white… Beto.”
“It’s turned out well and I don’t know what we sold in t-shirts and what we’ve sold in yard signs and bumper stickers for 3 bucks. That’s actually been a big part of what we’ve raised, people wanting to buy that gear or the signs. So Tony did good.”
And, O’Rourke said of Casas, “He’s a skater, actually.”
“In his free time,” his company bio says, “Tony pops crook grinds, trey flips, and back tails at the local skateparks.”
With that, I checked out of the hotel and as I put my stuff in the car to follow O’Rourke’s pickup to the block walk, he rolled by me.

Prepared to Shake Up State Senate Race, but Is She Truly an Insurgent?

Full text: Politics, like Hollywood, often looks to repeat a good thing: Find a formula that works, and stick with it.
That strategy has led Democrats across the country, in races large and small, to search for candidates who might become the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the giant slayer who took down Representative Joseph Crowley in New York's primary.
And in Brooklyn, there seemed to be no better or more natural choice than Julia Christine Salazar.
Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Salazar is young and Latina, poised and progressive, and a democratic socialist. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she boasted of blue-collar roots: she worked as a nanny, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as a bartender. Neither had ever been elected to office.
The easy and flattering comparison brought Ms. Salazar some fawning news media coverage, as she seeks to defeat State Senator Martin M. Dilan, who has represented north Brooklyn in Albany's upper chamber since 2003.
But as next week's Democratic primary draws near, scrutiny of Ms. Salazar's history has revealed numerous inconsistencies in her background that threaten to undermine her candidacy.
Most of the discrepancies center on her self-portrayal as a left-wing Democrat, an immigrant from Colombia, a Jewish woman with an Ivy League pedigree. But a series of published reports and interviews with family members have cast doubt and poked holes in her personal narrative.
A left-wing Democrat? Ms. Salazar, 27, was a registered Republican at one point, and was the leader of a Right to Life group while attending Columbia University. She also did not graduate, though her website implies that she did.
A Jewish woman? Her religious background is complicated: She was born in a Catholic family, and during college she served as president of Christians United for Israel. Ms. Salazar now identifies as Jewish, the result of a conversion she said she underwent in her early 20s.
A Colombian immigrant? Earlier this summer, Ms. Salazar said that she "immigrated to this country with my family when I was very little," at a campaign event captured on video. Yet she was born in South Florida and lived there, largely raised by her mother, who was born in New Jersey. Her father, Luis, was a Colombian pilot who became an American citizen before Ms. Salazar was born.
Mr. Dilan's campaign has cast such inconsistencies as fabrication, though Ms. Salazar's supporters say her version of events may be the result of semantics, campaign staff mistakes or gilding the lily -- or even Rashomon-like recollections -- rather than outright lies.
"It is a disservice to voters and constituents in our district that Senator Dilan continues to choose to obsess over details of my early childhood and personal development," Ms. Salazar said in a statement on Wednesday. "Rather than campaign on the issues."
Much of Ms. Salazar's political trouble emerged after an article in Tablet Magazine, which dived into the candidate's political and religious beliefs, concluding that her identity as a "politically radical working-class Jewish immigrant" had been largely self-created.
Other examinations followed, as did the inevitable pushback; a group of her college classmates jointly wrote a letter, published in the Forward on Wednesday, defending Ms. Salazar, saying that her "personal story is complex, and it has been misrepresented by her opponents."
In an interview last week in a coffee shop in Bushwick, Ms. Salazar said that she had undergone a political evolution since moving to New York in 2009 and believes she could be a senator "who has her ear to the ground, who has a record of actually building power in the community, bringing the voices of our community to City Hall and to Albany."
"I want to finally see a state senator, a state legislator representing this district who is actually accountable to the majority of residents of this district," she said.
She attempted to clarify her background, while continuing to embrace the idea of herself as a child of immigration, saying she had spent a lot of emotionally significant time in Bogotá as a child.
"I'm not an immigrant myself," she said. "Rather, I have always felt a deep connection to my father's immigrant experience because of the time I spent with our family in Colombia at such a young age."
Ms. Salazar said "my family was living in both the U.S. and Colombia at the time" she was a small child, before her parents' divorce in 1998, when she was 7.
"We were back and forth, literally, constantly," she said, later adding, "My earliest memories are of Colombia."
Interviews with Ms. Salazar's older brother, Alex, a mango farmer still living in Florida, and their mother, Christine Salazar, clouded the issue.
Mr. Salazar said he remembered only a pair of trips to Colombia during their childhood for short visits. "We weren't an immigrant family," Mr. Salazar, 29, said on Tuesday. "It was never something that was even considered."
He added that his family's financial situation was "certainly middle class, or upper middle class," while living in the comfortable community in Jupiter, Fla., north of West Palm Beach. ("I definitely disagree with Alex's memory," the candidate said, while noting that she was a toddler and infant for some of the time her parents were together, which "probably affects my ability to remember it.")
For her part, Ms. Salazar's mother backed up elements of her daughter's claims, recalling at least a half-dozen visits to Colombia, and that "the Colombian culture was a huge part of our family."
Ms. Salazar, 61, also said that while her children had lived in a nice house, she had sometimes struggled financially after she and her husband divorced. "If I could make it look easy for my kids, I did," she said. "I thought that economic hardship was not a burden that kids that were going through a divorce needed to experience."
Born into a Catholic family, Ms. Salazar said she converted to Judaism in her early 20s, and has been a part of a number of groups devoted to Jewish causes.
Ms. Salazar said her interest in Judaism is rooted in family history and their Sephardic roots in Spain, and was spurred as she was mourning her father's death from prostate cancer in 2009, just as she was preparing to move to New York to attend Columbia.
"I started to search for meaning in my father's death," she said, adding, "A lot of mysteries that I wanted to solve."
Ms. Salazar's mother said that neither side of the family was Jewish, though she confirmed her late husband's family had a Sephardic background, and that Julia had been curious about it. "That's where her interest stems from," she said, noting that her daughter had traveled to Israel during college. "This is not something that was invented for the purposes of this campaign."
Before her conversion, however, Ms. Salazar had been a Columbia chapter president of Christians United for Israel, and in 2012, she also was interviewed by the conservative commentator, Glenn Beck, and asked by Mr. Beck about rumors that professors at the university were "Muslim Brotherhood and communist," and exposing anti-Israel beliefs.
"How many are there, do you think?" Mr. Beck asked, as Ms. Salazar nodded.
"I think there are probably several," she answered, adding, "They are using the classroom as their podium to spread lies about the State of Israel."
Ms. Salazar said she left the Christians United group after a trip later that year to the West Bank, where she was disturbed by the Palestinians' living conditions.
Around the same time, Ms. Salazar -- who now supports the right to an abortion -- had been the president of Columbia Right to Life, once writing an editorial for the Columbia Spectator entitled "Support the Right to be a Parent."
She said her involvement in the group came through a friend and was short-lived, and focused around a health-services fee she opposed, which could be used to pay for abortion services. While she concedes she was "anti-abortion," she said she was never in favor of making abortion illegal, or engaged in tactics like picketing in front of clinics that offer the procedure.
"I wouldn't take the same position now," she said.
Ms. Salazar, now a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, admitted to once being registered a Republican, something she ascribed to being raised in a "very conservative political family" in Florida.
"Fox News was always on," she said.
Still, other details of Ms. Salazar's biography seem elided as well. On her campaign website, Ms. Salazar noted that she "supported herself through Columbia University as a nanny," though she acknowledged that she did not graduate from the university and does not intend to.
"I'm technically still on leave from my program since finishing my courses in 2014," Ms. Salazar said.
The cumulative effect of the various discrepancies have left Ms. Salazar's opponent shaking his head.
"It is hard to believe voters would judge Ms. Salazar based on whether she is an immigrant, or any of the other fanciful claims she has made in an attempt to create an identity that have been exposed as untrue," said Bob Liff, a spokesman for Mr. Dilan. "But voters do care if a candidate lies."

Mediaite: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Responds to Criticism of Her Posh Photo Shoot Outfit: 'Get Used to Me Slaying Lewks'

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not letting the criticism of her photo shoot clothes go unnoticed. Talk of her too posh clothes has sparked a lot of talk in conservative circles lately. During a segment on Fox and Friends on Saturday, the hosts joined in the slamming of the congressional candidate for wearing a posh outfit during a photo shoot. "And then there is this. The rising star of the Democratic Party has expensive tastes for a socialist," guest host Katie Pavlich said. She continued on: "For a photo shoot for Interview Magazine . Her pant suit -- appropriate -- retailing more than $2,800 alone. And the shoes $600 bucks." Pete Hegseth then chimed in, "It's tough being a socialist. It really is." Pavlich, though, wasn't done. "I mean I want a pair of $600 shoes. I think she should redistribute...hypocrisy at its best." The team at Fox and Friends was not the only ones bashing Ocasio-Cortez for the clothes she wore for the photo shoot. On Friday, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also called out the New York congressional candidate.
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pretends to be a champion of the people & believes the unemployment went down because were taking two jobs, just posed in a photoshoot with a $3,500 outfit, $625 shoes all while saying the rich have too much power and that socialism hasn't been tried," he wrote.

-- Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 14, 2018
Responding to that tweet, Ocasio-Cortez suggested the alt-right just doesn't know how photo shoots work.
She then added: "Get used to me slaying lewks because I am an excellent thrift shopper."
a) The alt-right doesn't seem to understand the concept of magazine shoots
b) You don't get to keep the clothes, duh
c) I don't "pretend" to fight for a Living Wage & Medicare for All. I do it.

Left-Wing Populist Gets a Right-Wing Rebuke Over a $3,000 Suit

Full text: Recently, Interview magazine published a conversation between the actress Kerry Washington and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accompanied by photographs of the young politician wearing a fitted blazer with wide lapels and green piping; a slim, matching set of trousers; and an elegant pair of black stilettos from Manolo Blahnik, the total cost for which was somewhere around $3,500.
Just as the left spun into fury when Melania Trump boarded a plane to the Mexican border to tour a shelter for immigrant children wearing a jacket that read, "I really don't care. Do U?," the right found outrage in what it regarded as discordant messaging -- a democratic socialist who looked as if she were going to Davos or Balthazar.
Here was "someone who pretends to be a champion of the people," as the conservative activist Charlie Kirk put it on Twitter, dressing in clothes worth a few months rent, all the while "saying the rich have too much power."
The hosts of "Fox & Friends," had a great time telling everyone they didn't own, or want, $600 shoes.
Appropriating signifiers from across class lines is, of course, a standard political move used to memorable advantage by, among others, George W. Bush, who successfully masked his patrician origins every time he put on a pair of Wranglers, a cowboy hat and a barn jacket.
While authenticity is a sought-after characteristic in contemporary American politics, its currency is fairly limited. It is hard to imagine someone like John V. Lindsay, coming up in today's system, persuading the poor he understood their suffering while looking as though he had started each morning on the squash court. The imperative to mirror the demographic you are trying to court will always be called out as hypocrisy by the opposition when it seems phony or betraying and yet often it is simply the deployment of tactical ingenuity.
Ms. Ocasio-Cortez needs the center-left -- surely emboldened by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's primary victory last week -- to warm to her, to imagine that she isn't going to tear down the castles. How terrifying can someone dressed as though she had just left a meeting with six venture capitalists with a rare bottle of scotch really be to the occupants of the higher tax brackets?
When the castigating got traction, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez shot back at her critics, pointing out the obvious -- that she did not buy the clothes she wore for the shoot. They were lent to the magazine for the purpose of taking pictures. The suit she wore came from Gabriela Hearst, an Uruguayan designer, whose sensibilities are not hostile to the Ocasio-Cortez brand -- the line makes use of compostable plastics for packaging and one runway show was inspired by Angela Davis. Any progressive who might have feared that the candidate was capitulating to the wealthy could say, "Well, at least she is not in Chanel."
I initially heard about the controversy from the Facebook posting of an investment banker I know whose politics do not lean to the far left. To my surprise, he was not critical. He posted one of the photographs from the Interview spread -- of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez seated on a crumbling stoop -- and the prices of the individual garments. "I love a socialist fashion icon," he wrote, adding that she looked good and that he loved her "seriously."
I imagined that he was equally thrilled with the announcement that Michael Bloomberg, the high-priest of Wall Street-loving centrism, was thinking about getting into the next presidential race.

Political organizations and their efforts towards midterm elections

Print Article
Republicans and Democrats on campus are trying to motivate students to turn out for next months‘ midterm election.
“Politicians don‘t expect you to turn out because historically they‘re right,” said Lauren Dooley, vice president of TCU College Republicans. “But technology has given our generation easier access to information than any before. Politicians will have to campaign to us, address our concerns, and propose policy we prefer, unless we prove them right by not turning out to vote.”
Her group meets every Wednesday and every other week they invite campaign officials and their staff to speak.
Meanwhile, the Young Democratic Leaders have partnered with campaigns to research how to inform potential voters how to register in Texas, specifically out-of-state students who are unaware they can register to vote in Texas.
“We want to be a home for students, while they may have the minority view, there‘s other students that are like-minded,” said Anthony Deininger, the founder and president of YDL.
The latest Quinnipiac Poll shows more women prefer Democratic candidates than men do, with 58 percent of women in comparison to 42 percent of men. Texas Democrats are hoping for a wave of young female voters to help turn the state blue.
At a recent event on campus, YDL proclaimed: “The future is female.”
The event, which was in the ballroom of the Brown-Lupton University Union, targeted young women and introduced them to Texas Democrats who are on the ballot this November. Olivia Albrecht wore this sweater to the YDL event last Wednesday in hopes to inspire more women to vote. Photo by Carolina Olivares.
Olivia Albrecht, a sophomore business marketing major who turned 18 over the summer, said she is eager to vote in the midterm election. She said she hopes to be a role model for her neighbors back home in California who are also eligible to vote in the primaries.
Women traditionally have higher voter turnouts in presidential elections; however, representation has always been lower in midterm elections, according to the Center for American Women and Politics .
The CAWP has also reported voters ages 18-24 represent the lowest percentage across the boards.
Some are suggesting the recent fight over the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh may galvanize women upset with the process.
New York District 14 representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who unseated a Democratic incumbent in the primary, is among a record-breaking number of female candidates and the number of women who on the midterm ballot for the House and the Senate, according to New York Times analysis.
We are asking Senators to respect survivors & the standards of the Supreme Court: #CancelKavanauagh.
Soon, the Senate will vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination.
But on November 6th, THE PEOPLE will vote on their Senators.

— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) October 5, 2018
“Ocasio-Cortez showed the effect grassroots efforts can have in this era,” said Dooley. “Voters want a candidate who‘s willing to get to meet them, forcing a lot of once-safe incumbents to campaign differently against these new, more active challengers.”
Deininger said the young Democrats and Republicans are planning to team up to address issues of a low young voter turnout and to unite students with differentiating viewpoints at TCU to get rid of such a division.

Character matters in political leadership

Full text: Donald Trump’s electoral humiliation this week has many roots. But to leadership historians it was perhaps, most of all, a judgement of character by American women. A record number of women voted against him, and for a record number of new women in Congress and at the state level.
Make no mistake, Trump did get thumped. Not only losing control of the House, but at least six governorships, and more than 300 state level seats. Yes, he was able to save Ted Cruz and two racist gubernatorial candidates in Florida and Georgia. But one and two point-victories give each side a night to celebrate.
Beto O’Rourke is now only a few thousand votes from ousting the detestable Texas senator next time. Women according to exit polls favoured Democrats over Trump by an astonishing 24 points. It was their revulsion at this president that told the tale on Tuesday night.
It was a fascinating gamble by Democrats. They ran more than three times as many women candidates nationally and at the state level than the GOP. Old time Democratic organizers grumbled quietly about the primary victories of 20-something, avowed socialist candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But women pushed them across the finish line, also electing Native American, Muslim, LGBTQ, and African American women along with her. Why? I would argue because events and #MeToo have made more women tougher judges of character in politics. “Is he trustworthy?” is the new acid test.
A leader who has lied and cheated his way through life may be able to deflect attention from his hollow soul for a time, but character will out. Short-term success is possible with no moral compass, but in the important tests of leadership Trump is doomed to fail. What this election may have demonstrated is that women today, more than men, are sensitive to fraudulent male politicians. Some men’s continuing greater willingness to cast a blind eye to character flaws in favour of tax cuts or job promises, no longer cut it with women. It appears to have an echo in Canada.
Doug Ford and Jason Kenney have enormous gender gaps with women voters. Perhaps it is simply a coincidence that they are also the two Canadian politicians who most openly ape the Trump narrative. That seems unlikely. Interestingly, there is not such a wide disparity in support across gender lines for any of the three federal leaders. Again, it may be a coincidence that each is seen to be a man of character, if of differing political capability.
Character is a difficult quality to assess, but obvious in its absence. The greatest Canadian leaders shared courage, vision, and determination — demonstrating character with the hardest choices. Bill Davis on separate school funding. Allan Blakeney on mining uranium. Pierre Trudeau on divorce, homosexuality and Asian immigration. You need not agree with their judgment to respect its courage.
As the American presidential historian, Michael Beschloss said to Wall Street journalist columnist Peggy Noonan last week: “Choose a candidate whose values and life experience you feel comfortable with, so that you can be confident about the vast majority of political decisions they will make, if elected, that you will never hear about.” In other words, the leader whose character gives you confidence about their judgment, even when unseen.
Canadians respect compromise, or “mutual accommodation.” But the yang to that yin is a belief in hard truth-telling, transparency, and authentic commitment to their citizens by their leaders.
As another great historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin puts it, all great leaders have “an ambition for self that becomes an ambition for something larger.” Delivering on it takes character.
So here’s to the millions of American women voters and candidates who on Tuesday declared loudly that character matters; who rejected racism, sexism, and white nationalism in favour of a group of courageous, often young women, who collectively drew a line in the sand — daring Donald Trump to cross it.

Full text: Amazon is going brick and mortar in New York City - making its plans official in a highly anticipated announcement Tuesday with Gov. Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio.
The Big Apple and Northern Virginia beat out 18 other finalists, including Boston, in a high-profile contest to bring home the tech powerhouse's new headquarters.
The trillion-dollar online retailer trumpeted the tentative deal, which includes nearly $3 billion in city and state incentives, as a win-win for itself and New Yorkers and promised it would bring more than 25,000 high-paying jobs to the city in the coming decade.
"Amazon will invest more than $2.5 billion in the construction and ongoing operation of this site," said the company's VP of Global Real Estate and Facilities John Schoettler at a press conference Tuesday. "We will help fund community infrastructure and donate sites for a new public school, a tech startup incubator and for use by artists and industrial businesses."
The new headquarters - one of two new HQs the company is setting up in addition to its current home base in Seattle - will be located in Long Island City on land currently owned in part by the city and Plaxall, a plastics design and construction company. The other new headquarters will be based in Arlington, Va.
Tuesday's announcement caps an epic contest that began in Sept. 2017 when Amazon invited cities across the U.S. and Canada to apply to become home to its second headquarters. Amazon announced 20 finalists in January, including Boston, Denver and Dallas.
Cuomo and de Blasio, who've feuded famously over the past five years, found something to agree on Tuesday with both hailing the plan as a boon to the city and the state.
"This is by far the biggest new jobs deal in the history of New York City [and] in the history of New York State," said de Blasio.
The mayor's support of the broader deal contradicts previous statements he's made about tax incentives.
"We will forgo big giveaways to a select few companies and instead pursue a city economic strategy that grows whole sectors of small businesses in emerging industries," he said in his first State of the City address in 2014. "Our aim is that within eight years, the majority of skilled technology-related jobs in New York City are being filled by those educated in New York City schools."
The arrangement with Amazon does not clearly lay out local hiring goals, but de Blasio seemed hopeful that nearby NYCHA residents and public school graduates would find jobs with the company.
Cuomo crowed that the average salary for jobs created through the deal would be $150,000 a year.
"The total state and city revenue that will be produced is estimated at $27.5 billion dollars," he said. "The revenue-to-incentive ratio is 9 to 1. That is the highest rate of return for an economic incentive program that the state has ever offered."
But the deal quickly drew a chorus of skeptics who questioned why it doesn't fully address issues like local hiring and the impact the new headquarters will have on rents.
"The consequences of thousands of new tech workers entering the housing market will be felt not just in Western Queens but in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and across the city," said Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer. "We'll need something like 25 million square feet of new residential housing to offset the pressure of this new demand."
Local residents also might not be too pleased with the deal's chopper provision, which would allow for a private helipad and "no more than 120" helicopter flights per year.
Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sounded off on Twitter too, raising questions about the approximately $3 billion in city and state tax incentives and grants Amazon will be entitled to under its memorandum of understanding with Empire State Development and the city's Economic Development Corporation.
"The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here," she wrote.
Team Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio argued that the deal includes provisions to prevent Amazon from reaping city and state benefits without delivering on its promises.
But there appears to be some wiggle room in the memorandum of understanding.
Under the deal, Amazon has until 2028 to create 25,000 new jobs. Each year there's a set job creation goal, but Amazon has to reach only 85 percent of the goal to avoid losing its state grant. After two years of failing to meet goals, the state could move to recapture the grant, but Amazon would still be able get it reinstated if it shows it's meeting job goals going forward.
On city-owned property involved, which will be leased to Amazon for 99 years and is about 25% of the site, the online retailer will make "payments in lieu of taxes," or PILOTs - in the same amount a private owner would pay in property taxes.
Over 40 years, that will amount to about $1.2 billion in payments, the city said. Half of it, $600 million, will go into a special fund to upgrade the infrastructure of Long Island City. The other half will go into the general fund.
Also, as part of the deal, the city and state will allow Plaxall to put up apartments on a parcel adjacent to the Amazon site that's currently zoned only for industrial use. The side deal requires Plaxall to set aside a yet-to-be-specified percentage of affordable apartments and commits it to building a school on another nearby site.

Some Queens Democrats oppose Amazon tax breaks

Author: Chaffin, Joshua

Publication info: FT.com ; London (Nov 14, 2018).

Full text: The Queens borough where Michael Gianaris grew up — and which he now represents in New York’s state senate — had beaten out dozens of competitors to grab one of the great golden geese of the new economy: anAmazonheadquarters.
Yet while Andrew Cuomo, New York governor, and Mayor Bill de Blasio were toasting their success on Tuesday at luring the online retailer to the Long Island City section of Queens, Mr Gianaris could hardly have been less pleased.
Along with a local member of the City Council, he issued a blistering statement accusing Amazon of “running a cynical game” in which it “duped” New York into offering$3bn in tax incentivesand subsidies to woo one of the wealthiest companies on earth.
Hours later, the deal did not look any better to Mr Gianaris, a Democrat who lives in the nearby neighbourhood of Astoria, and — like many of its residents — is of Greek-American heritage.
“This is an easy deal to oppose because it’s outrageous,” he said, claiming that Amazon and its promised 25,000 new workers would strain a fast-growing area where subway stations are already overwhelmed and school places are running short. “Amazon needs to talk about subsidising Long Island City — not the other way around.”
That downbeat assessment was echoed by other New York Democrats with ties to an area that Amazon will soon call one of its three homes — alongside its original headquarters in Seattle and another announced on Tuesday in Crystal City, northern Virginia.
It is a reminder of the sharp divisions within the local party as well as Amazon’s polarising place in the new economy. It is an awesome force capable of delivering well-paying jobs and riches to places such as Long Island City, but also of upending local businesses and unsettling longstanding communities.
In a series of tweets on Monday night, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young progressive who recently stunned the Democratic party by ousting an incumbent to capture a US House seat representing parts of Queens and the Bronx, took a dim view of its intentions.
“Amazon is a billion-dollar company,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. “The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.”
She demanded to know what types of jobs Amazon would be providing, their pay level and whether workers would have collective bargaining rights. “Displacement is not community development. Investing in luxury condos is not the same thing as investing in people and families,” she wrote.
Ron Kim, a Democrat who represents Queens in the state assembly, New York’s lower chamber, has drafted legislation that would, over five years, strip companies of $8.5bn in tax incentives and other inducements of the sort extended to Amazon. Mr Kim argued the money could yield “more tangible” returns if it were used to reduce student debt.
While other politicians question the amount of subsidies extended to Amazon, Mr Kim has more fundamental issues with the company. He views it as a predatory business that would ultimately harm the community and its small businesses.
“People in my neighbourhood — the local merchants, shop owners who have struggled to compete with Amazon — they know the truth behind the business model,” he said. Amazon, he argued, does not “just control the market — they become the market.”
That opinion was hardly unanimous. Eric Benaim, a leading real estate broker in Long Island City, had considered such concerns but ultimately disagreed with them. “They’re good guys. I understand their arguments,” he said of Mr Gianaris and his allies. “But at the end of the day, 25,000 new jobs are coming to Long Island City — and that’s a really good thing.”
Unlike Amazon, Mr Benaim was no outsider to the borough. “I’m a Queens boy! I’ve never lived anywhere else,” he said.
Whether the Amazon deal can be altered — let alone scuttled — is unclear. Even Mr Kim acknowledged it would be difficult for the legislature to roll back the promised subsidies when it convenes in January. Some have been channelled through Empire State Development, New York state’s economic development agency, and so beyond their reach.
Mr Gianaris said he was in the early stages of determining the sources of the promised subsidies and incentives to see if there was an opportunity to block them — perhaps by holding back funds from the relevant government agencies.
One veteran lobbyist monitoring the deal did not see much window to challenge it. “I would put the chances of blocking Amazon’s move to Long Island City at zero per cent,” the lobbyist predicted.
Another noted the difficulty of prevailing in a situation where Mr Cuomo and Mr De Blasio — frequent adversaries — were marching in lockstep.
At a press conference to unveil the deal, two of New York’s most senior politicians appeared to be covering their flanks as much as they were celebrating their victory.
Mr De Blasio urged critics to look “at the whole picture” and consider the $13.5bn in tax revenues he predicted Amazon would contribute to the city over the next 25 years — money he hoped would support a fairer city. The headquarters will be built with union labour.
Overall, the roughly $3.6bn the city and state will spend to bring Amazon to New York would eventually return more than $27bn in tax revenue, Mr Cuomo predicted — the highest ratio the state has ever achieved for such an investment. His tone was unapologetic.
“Either you are creating jobs or you are losing jobs,” Mr Cuomo declared. “Either you are part of the economy of tomorrow or you are part of the economy of yesterday. This is a competition.”

Ingraham noted, "They are respectively the first Muslim-American woman, the first black woman from Massachusetts and the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. They captioned the picture "squad." In another photo with a hashtag #changecantwait. -- Nancy Pelosi might have tagged this one #mobsquadhelp!"
Ingraham continued, "The anti-Israel bias of some of these congresswomen elect is downright disturbing."
Ingraham then lit into Ocasio-Cortez for calling Israel an "occupier," but saved her hardest punches for Tlaib and Omar.
"The two new Muslim members of Congress go even further than this. Tlaib endorses a one-state solution where Jews have no right to their sovereign state."

Ingraham, speaking of Tlaib, continued, "She said in an interview citing her Palestinian heritage, 'Separate but equal does not work.' And in 2014, Omar tweeted, "Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel."

"She recently called Israel -- one of our closest allies-- an apartheid regime," Ingraham said of Omar.

— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) November 14, 2018 Ocasio-Cortez of New York joined about 200 climate-change activists Tuesday as they staged a protest at the office of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Protesters are calling on Democratic leaders to put forward a “Green New Deal” that includes a swift transition to 100 percent renewable energy in line with findings of a recent report on climate change by United Nations. Some protesters were being arrested Tuesday after refusing to leave a hallway outside Pelosi’s office.
Ocasio-Cortez, 29, who is set to become the youngest member of Congress in January, addressed the group briefly before arrests were made.
Pelosi has pledged to reinstate a special committee on climate change after Democrats take control of the House. The California Democrat said in a statement that she welcomes the activists.

Mediaite: Media Reporter Gets Ratio'd Into Another Dimension For Bad Tweet About Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Full text: "The Ratio", Deadspin writer David Roth once explained, "is the triple crown of bad tweets." It's when a Twitter user posts something so garbage that the replies to their post outnumber its likes and retweets by a remarkable ratio. Eddie Scarry , a media reporter for the conservative Washington Examiner, posted this tweet on what was otherwise a sleepy Thursday afternoon, and it is getting ratio'd into the stratosphere:Hill staffer sent me this pic of Ocasio-Cortez they took just now. I'll tell you something: that jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles. pic.twitter.com/oaLpy5aXlt -- Eddie Scarry (@eScarry) November 15, 2018 The tweet, ostensibly, takes aim at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 's claims that she struggles to afford rent. Scarry, using a surreptitiously taken photo of the young congresswoman that was apparently sent to him, wrote in his tweet that her very normal jacket and coat are evidence she is dishonest about her financial situation.
The response was swift, and brutal. As of writing, Scarry's tweet has a ratio that might just be unprecedented on Twitter.com:
Scarry was defiant. But his second tweet explaining the first only kicked off a rare double ratio:

The Week in Tech: Amazon Finally Makes an HQ2 Decision

Full text: Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news , offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here .
Hello from Seattle. I’m Karen Weise, the new tech correspondent here. As you might imagine, the announcement of Amazon’s decision in what it had billed as a search for a second headquarters, a.k.a. HQ2, has dominated news here this week.
After 14 months of near silence from the company — and a week of reporting that it was closing in on a choice — Amazon finally said it would split HQ2 in two, between the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Va., just across the Potomac River from Washington.
I’ve found the HQ2 search and the obsession around it fascinating because of the blatant display of Amazon’s power to promise jobs and lobby politicians, thanks to the company’s market dominance and consumer adoration.
The choice to enter New York is particularly interesting because Amazon will need to deal with a local political environment that is far more complex than its hometown’s.
Seattle has plenty of activism — from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests to becoming the first big city to pass a $15 minimum wage — and certainly there’s some antagonism toward Amazon. But the labor, media and electoral politics of New York are a different breed.
That’s been evident in the blowback to the more than $2 billion in planned tax subsidies there. That the state promised to help Amazon get access to a helipad didn’t help.
The New York Post cover blared “Queens Ransom” next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read “Stay the Helipad Out.”
Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York, joined the chorus of skeptics. “One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from taxpayers,” she wrote on Twitter. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming Democratic representative for parts of Queens, as well as the Bronx, said she had heard “outrage” from her constituents.
Until recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle’s civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon’s main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics.
That began to change in 2015, when Amazon’s real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?
When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, “I’d call those branch offices.” It’s a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.
And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. “We know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth,” Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. “We are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I’m on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us.”
How that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon’s growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That’s a mix of the technical and creative work that’s already thriving in the city.
Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.
But Amazon’s agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state’s goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what’s Amazon’s vision there?
Some other tech stories of note this week:
■ I don’t want to let HQ2 suck even more oxygen out of the room than it already has, so please take the time to read the investigation five incredible colleagues published on Wednesday. The report looks into how Facebook’s top leadership failed to fully reckon with the company’s complicity in political and social manipulation. It provides a rarely critical and comprehensive look into the top ranks of the company.
■ Uber lost more than $1 billion last quarter, and its growth is slowing, Kate Conger reports. This news comes as the ride-hailing company marches toward a 2019 public offering.
■ How weird is social media marketing? Sapna Maheshwari has one word for you: nanoinfluencers .
■ And finally, just in case you think it’s all bad news about tech this week, Farhad Manjoo has this charming love letter to Google Photos. As he said, “Who expects software to make them cry?”

Seth Meyers Mocks Fox News’ Laura Ingraham for Making Ocasio-Cortez Look Good

Full text: Every time Fox News tries to make Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez look bad it somehow blows up in their face.
It happened last July when Sean Hannity put the New York Democrat’s progressive platform on his screen in an attempt to scare viewers. “Pretty much!” she tweeted along with the screenshot. Later that same month, Fox & Friends interviewed a writer for The Daily Caller who attended one of Ocasio-Cortez’s rallies and reported back about the horrors of her promises of free health care and education for children. “If you’re not really paying attention to how they’re going to pay for it, or the rest of that, it’s easy to fall into that trap and say, ‘My kids deserve this,’” the woman said.
This week, after Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow freshmen Democratic House members arrived in Washington, it happened again.
As Seth Meyers laid out toward the end of his latest “A Closer Look” segment on President Donald Trump’s post-midterms funk, “One of the keys to the Democrats’ success is that they ran on an agenda focused on issues like health care and now they’ll have power to pass bills in the House like Medicare for All,” something that “has right-wing Fox News pundits like Laura Ingraham freaking out.”
On her show Tuesday night, Ingraham described Ocasio-Cortez and other Democratic women of color elected the week before as representing “some of the most radical views in Congress.” What followed was a bullet-point list of those views, which included “free college for all,” “free health care for all,” “Abolish ICE” and a “green new deal.”
“Wait, they’re trying to scare us with free health care?” Meyers asked incredulously. “You know an idea is popular when even Fox News can’t make it sound bad. What’s next, these radical socialists are proposing crazy new ideas like free pizza, a trunk full of gold, Hamilton tickets and a kiss from Ryan Gosling?”
Or as Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Wednesday morning, “Oh no! They discovered our vast conspiracy to take care of children and save the planet.”

At what cost? Debate swirls on 'giveaways' after Amazon HQ deal

Author: Lever, Rob

Publication info: AFP International Text Wire in English ; Washington [Washington]18 Nov 2018.

http://libproxy.usc.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2134504151?accountid=14749

Full text: As the winners of the biggest corporate prize in decades -- the new Amazon headquarters -- relished their victory, debate was still raging over the billions of dollars in incentives offered to attract the fast-growing US technology colossus.
The new Amazon "HQ2" with an estimated $5 billion investment creating 50,000 new jobs will be split between the Long Island City district in New York and Crystal City, a Virginia community across the Potomac River from the US capital Washington.
Officials in both communities welcomed what they said would be a major economic boost from Amazon in creating jobs, new facilities and infrastructure, and that the plans would be positive for public coffers.
But critics warned that tax incentives and investments from state and local governments -- up to $3 billion in New York and $2.5 billion in Virginia -- may outweigh the economic benefits from Amazon's investments.
Amazon's search for incentives -- derided by some as a "Hunger Games" competition -- is a common practice in the United States.
A Brookings Institution report, based on New York Times data, estimates some $90 billion given annually in corporate incentives from state and local governments.
- Do incentives work? -
Michael Farren, a George Mason University research fellow who specializes in corporate relocations, said these kinds of incentives rarely make the difference in a company decision.
"Corporate relocation decisions are made on the basis of things that have deeper impact on the business' bottom line, like the availability of a skilled workforce," he said.
"So why do they do this? It's because otherwise politicians couldn't claim credit for the deals."
Farren noted that Amazon could have won even heftier tax benefits if it had crossed the Potomac into Maryland which offered a package worth more than $8 billion, or chose to locate west of New York in Newark, where $7 billion was being offered.
Still, the deal has faced criticism from those claiming Amazon does not need what some describe as "corporate welfare."
"One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from the taxpayers while too many New York families struggle to make ends meet," New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said on Twitter.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat elected to Congress from a district that includes part of Queens, voiced similar concerns, tweeting that, "We need to focus on good health care, living wages, affordable rent.
Corporations that offer none of those things should be met w/ skepticism."
The deal has been hit from the right as well, with conservative economist Veronique de Rugy writing in the National Review: "I can't believe I'm saying this, but Ocasio-Cortez is mostly correct on this matter, and her conservative critics are wrong. Handouts like this to Amazon and other prominent companies are appalling in their cronyism, pure and simple."
Farren said subsidies distort the economy and that instead of betting on a specific company or industry, cities should focus on improvements to education and infrastructure that make them attractive places to live and work.
- 'Taxpayers protected' -
But Tom Stringer, a corporate real estate advisor with the consulting firm BDO, said critics of the Amazon deal may not be reading the fine print.
"Both states are getting terrific deals if things come to fruition," Stringer told AFP.
Stringer said that the agreements are structured as "pay as you go programs," and that "if Amazon does not deliver they are not getting the benefits. Taxpayers are pretty well protected."
Nonetheless, the question of public subsidies has come into sharper focus with deals concerning Amazon and Foxconn, a Taiwan-based electronic firm that produces for Apple and other major firms and agreed to build a factory in Wisconsin.
The $3 billion in incentives for Foxconn -- projected to grow to $4 billion -- to create 13,000 jobs amounts to a subsidy of more than $200,000 per job, compared with around $20,000 per job for Amazon.
Stringer said the Foxconn deal, which was announced by President Donald Trump, had some "highly unusual" elements compared to Amazon's.
"There are a lot of political implications with Foxconn that are very different from what's on display with Amazon," he said.
- Wisconsin boondoggle? -
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who negotiated the Foxconn deal, lost his re-election bid this month amid concerns over the rising costs and estimates for lower job creation.
Even some companies have begun to acknowledge problems with the tradition of public subsidies.
Walt Disney Co. sent a letter to the city of Anaheim, California, earlier this year asking for an end to tax breaks, saying they created an "adversarial climate."
But Stringer argued that incentives remain "critically important" as a way to lure businesses and spur economic development.
"Everybody is kidding themselves if they think incentives don't make a difference," he said.
Darrell West, head of governance studies at Brookings, said that "it is important (for officials) to be hard-nosed about negotiations so that both sides benefit from these deals."
He also acknowledged that companies like Amazon and Foxconn "had clear bargaining advantages because of the size of their possible investment."

In America, a week of fighting fires -- and demons

Author: Jane Greenway Carr

Publication info: CNN Commentary ; Atlanta [Atlanta]18 Nov 2018.

http://libproxy.usc.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2134796918?accountid=14749

Full text: They are the images we can't unsee -- the torches on a college campus and the moment of a car's impact in Charlottesville, the crime scene tape and the vehicles of first responders in Pittsburgh and Thousand Oaks, the swastikas painted on community centers and the screenshots after the fact of dark threats lodged or warning signs missed on social media.
But what happens when the image of hate is something else? It may not look so different from what we see in a World War II documentary or an educational curriculum about the Holocaust, wrote Jill Filipovic, but there it was in a photograph, gone viral this week, of Wisconsin high school students giving an apparent Nazi salute before their prom: "a terrifying sight," contended Filipovic, because "right-wing terrorism, including white supremacist and anti-Semitic terrorism, is the biggest domestic terror threat Americans now face."
If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the numbers don't lie. The FBI released updated data this week showing the biggest three-year increase in reported hate crimes in nearly 20 years, with alarming surges in anti-Arab and anti-Jewish incidents. That's scary enough. What's even worse, argued Maya Berry and Kai Wiggins, is that somehow the FBI's numbers don't include some of the "most horrific acts of bias-motivated violence" last year -- including the killings of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville and Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Olathe, Kansas.
Prejudice need not announce itself in the form of a hate crime, either, as Koritha Mitchell observed of Cindy Hyde-Smith's "joke" about public hanging, when its violent legacy is built into the foundation of our politics: "Only a person whose ancestors or family members bore no risk of being lynched themselves would dismiss as 'ridiculous' objections to making hanging into a public political joke in Mississippi." Rachel James-Terry, writing for the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, noted that any surprise at Hyde-Smith's lack of contrition is misplaced: she's talking to her base and hasn't hurt anyone who matters to her. Shawn Turner demonstrated that the GOP's issues with race and racism are bigger than any region -- they continue to be a national, and as Errol Louis pointed out, a presidential, problem.
Joseph Sakran, a trauma surgeon and gunshot survivor, cautioned America against letting anyone -- especially the NRA -- get in the way of fighting violence. "Death awaits us at movies and nightclubs, at our elementary schools and colleges, in our synagogues and in our mosques and churches," wrote Suzanne Roberts in a "love letter" to her hometown of Thousand Oaks. "Don't succumb" to this "terminal diagnosis."
There's a reason they call it 'techlash'
We all should have known better. That seemed to be the consensus after Amazon announced its HQ2 would be split between the New York City borough of Queens and Northern Virginia. "So much for the Rust Belt uplift story," wrote Mark Muro and Clara Hendrickson for CNN Business Perspectives.
Facebook embodied two of Oxford Dictionaries' top words of 2018 this week, "techlash" and "toxic." So concluded Charles Arthur, who cited a New York Times investigative piece revealing Facebook's shady dealings with a PR firm to declare it's time to admit we're addicted, and we might be reaching the same tipping point with social networks that we met on public smoking.
The women who won't take no for an answer aren't taking it easy
New US Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia told The Daily that the women who followed each other's exploits on the campaign trail are now meeting up and making friends. But a number of trailblazers who have changed the face of Congress are also still fighting the same old sexist tropes, like "I'm fine with women in power, just not this one specific woman currently in power" (as Alexandra Petri put it in The Washington Post about Nancy Pelosi) and "her outfit is too nice for her to have problems" (as Megan Garber debunked for The Atlantic over a sexist tweet of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez). David Axelrod conveyed a simple message to Democrats: Think twice before you reject Pelosi.
Meanwhile, for those who aspire to make politics about more than sexism and snark, voters may have their backs. Karine Jean-Pierre wrote that when voters are given the option to express themselves directly, more often than not they make choices that affirm love and compassion -- like re-enfranchising 1.4 million ex-felons in Florida and expanding Medicaid.
The first lady also refused to take no for an answer this week. As Michael D'Antonio pointed out, Melania Trump beat her husband, the leader of the free world, at his own game, publicly forcing the ouster of a deputy national security adviser -- a dangerous move, according to Juliette Kayyem. In the first round of CNN's legal battle to restore the White House credentials of correspondent Jim Acosta, a judge sided with the network. Elie Honig called it a victory for the free press.
In California, the apocalypse is getting worse
With a staggering number of missing and a rising death toll, the fires in California, as Bay Area poet Tess Taylor described it, look increasingly like the end of the world: "I do want to say to anyone listening: This year's apocalypse is worse than last year's apocalypse. And what I recognized in myself this year -- even as this past week of bad air has passed -- has been a strange, terrible, low-level resignation, rattling around in me like the low burning in my lungs."
To the south, Robert Greene lamented in the Los Angeles Times that while he grew up watching the hills burn, the fires in L.A. and elsewhere feel different now, more cruel -- "Fire no longer seems regenerative," he said.
The search continues for victims and for better fire prevention strategies; research ecologist Chad Hanson warned that the Trump administration's call for more logging "creates a dangerous and false sense of security."
The kids are (fighting to make sure others) are all right
But where are the young people? It's a question that dominated the midterm elections and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell has an answer. From Lahore to Ramallah to Maine, here's where they are: Young people are showing up for democracy.
They're fighting for gender equality as well, even with new Title IX rules from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that Amanda Marcotte said for Salon "appear to be focused mostly on throwing up obstacles to reporting, and making victims wonder if it's worth their while to ask for help." In National Review, David French disagreed; he called the rules a "basic" restoration of fairness. Sixteen-year-old Anna Sophia Lotman rejected the idea of giving girls "toolkits" or "checklists" for avoiding harassment or assault. Try giving men and boys a checklist to realize "women's issues" like ending rape culture are their problem, too, she said.
And they're fighting from beyond the grave. Kate O'Neill offered a wrenching remembrance of her sister Madelyn, and how her death has further galvanized the fight against opioid addiction: "We call it the Opioid Epidemic, but that useless phrase doesn't describe what is happening to actual human beings in communities across our country. It should be called the My Beautiful Little Sister Lost Custody of Her Son, Stole From and Conned People, Was Raped and Burned With Cigarettes, Tried to Commit Suicide, Had Sex for Drugs and Money, Went to Jail, Was Homeless, and Ultimately Lost Everything Including Her Own Life Epidemic."
What Michelle Obama, 'Saturday Night Live' and American literary culture have in common
Michelle Obama's memoir, "Becoming," went on sale Tuesday and amid all the talk of why she stopped trying to smile at the inauguration, Kate Brower and Laura Beers zeroed in on two ways the former first lady's story could make a difference in the real lives of others: sharing her marital struggles with the former President and her journey with in vitro fertilization. As Brower wrote, "(Leadership is) recognizing that being a role model means engaging and talking about one's imperfections, not pretending they don't exist."
That's a message "Saturday Night Live" took to heart by inviting Dan Crenshaw to appear with Pete Davidson, who had mocked him the week before. Crenshaw told the audience, "We can remember what brings us together as a country and still see the good in each other." Dean Obeidallah warned: "The only thing stopping us from doing more of that is ourselves."
We may not be there yet when it comes to politics, but if what we read is any indication, we're making progress at being more inclusive. At the National Book Awards held this week in New York, writers of color took all five of the top literary prizes; as noted by Constance Grady for Vox, "Throughout the evening, speakers pointed to books as a weapon against bigotry and hate."
Stan Lee lives on in you
Marvel superhero creator Stan Lee died this week at the age of 95. LZ Granderson turned his grief to homage: "No, we don't have super strength and we can't fly, but we fight society's ills armed with the principles woven into the words of some of our favorites characters. This is how Stan Lee lives on. Not with T-shirts or blockbuster movies but by our willingness to use whatever power we have for good and not evil." Or, to paraphrase Gene Seymour's remembrance of screenwriter and novelist William Goldman, another legendary creator who passed on this week: art can remind us at critical times in our lives and national consciousness how much words matter.
Remember that with great power comes great responsibility.

— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) November 14, 2018 Ingraham has landed in hot water before for singling out minority groups as not part of main-street America. In August she was criticized for a racially charged monologue that many dubbed a "white supremacist" speech. Ingraham said, that “in major parts of the country, it does seem that the America we know and love doesn’t exist anymore. Massive demographic changes have been foisted on the American people and they’re changes that none of us ever voted for and most of us don’t like.”
Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter to Fox's coverage of her proposals as radical, writing, "Oh no! They discovered our vast conspiracy to take care of children and save the planet."
Ocasio-Cortez of New York joined about 200 climate-change activists Tuesday as they staged a protest at the office of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Protesters are calling on Democratic leaders to put forward a “Green New Deal” that includes a swift transition to 100 percent renewable energy in line with findings of a recent report on climate change by United Nations. Some protesters were being arrested Tuesday after refusing to leave a hallway outside Pelosi’s office.
Ocasio-Cortez, 29, who is set to become the youngest member of Congress in January, addressed the group briefly before arrests were made.
Pelosi has pledged to reinstate a special committee on climate change after Democrats take control of the House. The California Democrat said in a statement that she welcomes the activists.

The New York Post cover blared "Queens Ransom" next to a picture of the company founder, Jeff Bezos, laughing in a helicopter holding bags of cash. A hundred people protested at the Long Island City site, waving signs like one that read "Stay the Helipad Out."
Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democratic senator from New York, joined the chorus of skeptics. "One of the wealthiest companies in history should not be receiving financial assistance from taxpayers," she wrote on Twitter. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the incoming Democratic representative for parts of Queens, as well as the Bronx, said she had heard "outrage" from her constituents.
Until recently, Amazon barely involved itself in Seattle's civic politics. Its growth was steady for more than a decade, only kicking into high gear the past few years. For a while, Amazon's main involvement with city hall was more about small things like approvals for street vacations than major politics.
That began to change in 2015, when Amazon's real estate head, John Schoettler, who was deeply involved in the HQ2 search, led the local Chamber of Commerce. Earlier this year, Amazon publicly fought a new tax to pay for homeless services and affordable housing. But there was never a singular moment like this when Seattle got to ask: Do we want Amazon here? If so, do we want taxpayers to pay for it?
When news of a split HQ2 broke, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said, "I'd call those branch offices." It's a good zinger, but while Seattle may want to call it a win, several experts pointed out to me that Amazon will now have three cities to pit against one another for decades to come. Talk about leverage.
And Amazon is still calling the two new locations headquarters. "We know there will be leaders and teams in all three headquarters as we map out the growth," Jay Carney, a senior vice president at Amazon, told me. "We are already a company that spans the country, with employees in over 45 states. I'm on the leadership team but live in D.C. and am in Seattle today. It reinforces what already exists for us."
How that division shakes out will be interesting to track. The New York office is already home to much of Amazon's growing advertising group, which has become almost an obsession among investors because of its high margins. That's a mix of the technical and creative work that's already thriving in the city.
Many had suggested that a Washington-area choice could signal a growing dependence on government contracts, like a $10 billion cloud deal for the Defense Department that Amazon is favored to win.
But Amazon's agreement with Virginia specifically states that the incentives Amazon gets will decrease if more than 10 percent of the work done at that location is for federal contracts, something that reflects the state's goal of diversifying its economy away from government work. So what's Amazon's vision there?
Some other tech stories of note this week:
■ I don't want to let HQ2 suck even more oxygen out of the room than it already has, so please take the time to read the investigation five incredible colleagues published on Wednesday. The report looks into how Facebook's top leadership failed to fully reckon with the company's complicity in political and social manipulation. It provides a rarely critical and comprehensive look into the top ranks of the company.
■ Uber lost more than $1 billion last quarter, and its growth is slowing, Kate Conger reports. This news comes as the ride-hailing company marches toward a 2019 public offering.
■ How weird is social media marketing? Sapna Maheshwari has one word for you: nanoinfluencers.
■ And finally, just in case you think it's all bad news about tech this week, Farhad Manjoo has this charming love letter to Google Photos. As he said, "Who expects software to make them cry?"

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Quoting Cardi B on Twitter, and We’re Here for It

Full text: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the astronomically popular, 29-year-old congresswoman from the Bronx, has set her opponents back on their heels time and time again by trusting her instincts and just being herself on social media.
For example: If we’ve learned absolutely anything as a society from her positively epic takedown of The Washington Examiner reporter Eddie Scarry, it’s that Ocasio-Cortez is extremely skillful at using Twitter. She is not to be messed with unless it’s absolutely necessary.

Scarry tweeted a picture of Ocasio-Cortez’s outfit taken from behind her, accompanied by a caption implying that the quality of her garments indicated that she wasn’t as financially strapped as her messaging implied.
His snarky take was eviscerated so thoroughly it instantly became a meme: His line “I’ll tell you something: that jacket and coat don’t look like a girl who struggles” was repurposed into a punch line by the good people of the internet.

On Tuesday, Ocasio-Cortez kept up her social media hot streak with a type of post that’s archetypal and instantly recognizable to those of us who spent a ton of time on MySpace, AOL and Facebook circa 2009: She cited song lyrics.
Specifically, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted lyrics from “Best Life” by rapper Cardi B, another well-liked celebrity from the Bronx.
I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me/
Hair when it's messed up, crib when it's filthy/
Way-before-the-deal me, work-to-pay-the-bills me/
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me/
But never did I change, never been ashamed/

Never did I switch, story stayed the same/
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Moodhttps://t.co/KpZzlzOue6
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) November 20, 2018
It’s the “mood” that really cinches it.
With this tweet, it’s possible that Ocasio-Cortez is referring to the recent nights she’s spent answering questions on Instagram Live, a feature that allows public figures to address their audiences and answer questions in real time.
AOC, however, is not your everyday politician. Can you imagine Hillary Clinton throwing on a pair of beat-up pajamas, firing up her webcam and chatting with potential voters about universal healthcare and raising the minimum wage, all while simultaneously preparing a healthy dinner?

Didn’t think so. What Ocasio-Cortez is doing by being so accessible online is truly and absolutely unprecedented in politics. Cardi B, whose commitment to radical transparency knows no bounds, would certainly approve.

According to CNN, which first reported the story, the battered shoes the New York Congresswoman-elect wore during her campaign will be on display as part of the Cornell Costume Collection.
The exhibit titled "WOMEN EMPOWERED: Fashions from the Frontline," opens on Dec. 6.
Ocasio-Cortez's fashion choices have been both the source of comment and derision, however, the worn tennis shoes were actually tweeted out by Ocasio-Cortez herself as a way to show how much she hustled to win the primary.
Some folks are saying I won for "demographic" reasons.
1st of all, that's false. We won w/voters of all kinds.
2nd, here's my 1st pair of campaign shoes. I knocked doors until rainwater came through my soles.
Respect the hustle. We won bc we out-worked the competition. Period. pic.twitter.com/RbpQMYTiWY

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Lindsey Graham spar on Twitter over Tijuana-Holocaust comparison

Author: Correll, Diana Stancy

Publication info: The Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]27 Nov 2018.

Full text: Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is sparring with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on Twitter over immigration policy, after Ocasio-Cortez compared the plight of migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. to Jewish families seeking refuge from Nazi Germany.

The back-and-forth began Sunday when Ocasio-Cortez tweeted after border agents used tear gas against some migrants who attempted to illegally enter the U.S. near Tijuana, Mexico.

“Asking to be considered a refugee & applying for status isn’t a crime. It wasn’t for Jewish families fleeing Germany,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted along with a photo from NBC News depicting a woman and children fleeing the tear gas. “It wasn’t for targeted families fleeing Rwanda. It wasn’t for communities fleeing war-torn Syria. And it isn’t for those fleeing violence in Central America.”

Graham responded, advising Ocasio-Cortez to visit the Holocaust Museum to "help her better understand the differences between the Holocaust and the caravan in Tijuana." He also called on Congress to pass immigration reform legislation to heighten border security.

The comment didn’t go unnoticed by Ocasio-Cortez, who told Graham “the point of such a treasured museum is to bring its lessons to present day” and accused the Trump administration of violating human rights. She also referenced a remark Graham made last month during an interview with “Fox & Friends” when he said it would be “like terrible” if a DNA test revealed he was Iranian.

“While we’re recommending museums @LindseyGrahamSC, I heard your ‘joke’ about ethnic DNA preferences last month,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Monday evening. “Perhaps you would enjoy a visit (or revisit) to the Smithsonian Museum of African-American History and Culture (@NMAAHC). It’s a great educational experience.”

The dispute comes as Congress is facing a deadline next month to pass a 2019 spending bill that includes a minimum of $1.6 billion in wall funding, even though President Trump and some GOP lawmakers have pushed for as much as $5 billion.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Monday that 600 members of the 10,000 migrants that are part of the caravan making their way from Central America to the U.S. were convicted criminals in their countries of origin, but did not provide sourcing for the number.

3 key points from climate report

Author: Ave, Jack

Publication info: University Wire ; Carlsbad [Carlsbad]29 Nov 2018.

“Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?”
@realDonaldTrump 11/21/2018
Last Friday, the United States government published the National Climate Assessment, a report that measures the development of climate change backed by thirteen federal agencies. This extensive report tracks the effects of climate change on the United States.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , one of the thirteen agencies who authored the report, released a press statement detailing the assessment as, “A new federal report finds that climate change is affecting the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation and human health and welfare across the U.S. and its territories.”
It seems that the current administration’s attempt to bury the report the day after a Thanksgiving failed. The hash tag #ClimateFriday gained popularity over the holiday weekend, picking up momentum from tweets by Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Former Vice-President Al Gore.
Two days before the release of the report, President Donald J. Trump preemptively tweeted an attack on climate change believers. However, the Associated Press found on Saturday, Nov. 24 that the report from his own administration “frequently contradicts” Trump.
While the report faces criticisms of being inaccessible and hard to read for the average citizen, there are three key take-a-ways that every person should be aware of.
1. Climate change is caused by human activity
While a vast majority of the scientific community believes that climate change is anthropocentric, critics of environmental protection claim that any extreme heating or cooling is rather caused by natural weather cycles.
Seth Borenstein from the Associated Press debunked this when he reported that, “Citing numerous studies, the [National Climate Assessment] says more than 90 percent of the current warming is caused by humans. Without greenhouse gases, natural forces — such as changes in energy from the sun — would be slightly cooling Earth.”
2. Extreme heat will become more common; extreme cold will become less likely
In the first chapter of the assessment, the authors found that the length of heat-wave season has increased by over forty-days in the last sixty years. The report finds that, “Extreme high temperatures are projected to increase even more than average temperatures. Cold waves are projected to become less intense and heat waves more intense. The number of days below freezing is projected to decline, while the number of days above 90°F is projected to rise.”
3. Climate change has magnified the damage of wildfires
With the recent fires across California making national headlines, this assessment offers an explanation as to why this widespread devastation was so hard to contain. The report found that, “Climate change has driven the wildfire increase, particularly by drying forests and making them more susceptible to burning. Specifically, increased temperatures have intensified drought in California, contributed to drought in the Colorado River Basin, reduced snowpack, and caused spring-like temperatures to occur earlier in the year.”
All in all, the 2018 National Climate Assessment paints a gruesome picture for our immediate future. However, public officials who don’t take this report seriously are ignoring the warning signs from their own government. Until action is taken, this report confirms that more innocent lives will be lost at the hands of climate change deniers. When politicians look at the climate crisis through a rose-colored glass, the red flags just look like flags.

Ocasio-Cortez learns the hora at Hannukah celebration

Full text: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been criticized for her positions on Israel, but she’s clearly not opposed to a bit of Israeli folk dancing.
The Democratic superstar on the cusp of making history as the youngest woman elected to Congress danced the hora for the first time Sunday as she attended a Hannukah celebration with Jews for Racial and Economic Justice in Queens.
“What a beautiful and touching evening we shared tonight for our community Chanukah celebration,” she tweeted. “Thank you Rabbi Mia for the opportunity of helping you light the shamash, and thank you @JFRASJNYC for assembling the festivities! May tonight’s light and hope spark many others.”
She then posted a video of herself dancing the hora with the caption: “Plus I can never turn down an opportunity to try a new dance!”

“We can’t wait to bring light together to D.C,” the far-left Jewish organization wrote.
The 29-year-old, blessed with telegenic looks, charisma and bursting with youthful idealism, is both a media darling and a lightning rod for criticism.
Her comments on Israel have prompted criticism from the right and left.
Although she has commented infrequently on foreign affairs, in May she called the killing of Palestinian protesters by Israeli troops on the Gaza border fence a “massacre.”
Then in July Ocasio-Cortez decried the “occupation of Palestine” during a television interview, but stumbled when pressed to explain what she meant.
Appearing July 13 on PBS’s “Firing Line,” Ocasio-Cortez admitted that she was “not the expert” on the issue, drawing accusations that she was “clueless.”
On “Firing Line,” host Margaret Hoover asked Ocasio-Cortez “What is your position on Israel?” Ocasio-Cortez responded, “I believe absolutely in Israel’s right to exist.” She added: “I am a proponent of a two-state solution.” The candidate said her previous position on the Gaza clashes “is not a referendum on the State of Israel.”
When pressed to explain herself further she said “I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue,” and “I just look at things through a human rights lens and I may not use the right words… Middle Eastern politics is not exactly at my kitchen table every night.”
However, in August she was cheered at an event at the New York’s Jewish museum, albeit one that did not touch on Israel or the Jewish community.

Ocasio-Cortez tells Hannukah celebration she is descended from Sephardic Jews

Full text: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told the audience at a Hannukah celebration on Sunday evening that she is descended from Sephardic Jews who fled Spain during the Inquisition.
At the event organized by Jews for Racial and Economic Justice in Queens, New York, the newly elected Democratic congresswoman described how Jews fleeing persecution arrived in Puerto Rico, where cultures would blend and some outwardly practicing Catholics would also keep a menorah at home.
“One of the things that we discovered about ourselves is that a very long time ago, generations and generations ago, my family consisted of Sephardic Jews,” she said.
In a lighthearted moment, Ocasio-Cortez then seemed to respond to an audience member who said they had always suspected she was Jewish.
“I knew it! I sensed it!” she said, to laughs from the audience.

“So many of our destinies are tied beyond our understanding,” she said, according to a tweet from a Haaretz journalist.
The Spanish Inquisition was a campaign of persecution against Jews and other non-Christians that the Catholic Church and the Spanish royal house initiated in 1492.
The Democratic superstar, who is the youngest woman elected to Congress, also danced Israeli folk dance the hora for the first time at the event.

12 Days of Feminists: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Author: Stacy Lee Kong

Publication info: Flare (Online) ; Toronto (Dec 21, 2018).

Full text: Confession: Until recently, I didn’t know a ton about America’s non-presidential elections. Senators, governors, congress…people? I wasn’t *entirely* sure what any of those elected officials actually did, nor did I really care. (In my defence, I don’t live there. And I do have a much better understanding of Canada’s various elected officials, I swear.) But then, back in June, stories about an exciting young congressional candidate from the Bronx started appearing on my various news feeds, and I began to care—deeply.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was everything politicians often aren’t: young, female, working class, internet-savvy, sassy and, most importantly, unapologetically progressive. I think I had internalized a (very Canadian, I think) idea that for left-wing politicians to succeed, they needed to compromise. After all, that’s often what we’ve seen with everyone from Barack Obama to Justin Trudeau. But Ocasio-Cortez was uncompromising in the very best way.
View this post on Instagram by @kimothyjoy, quote from interview with @cooties.zine last year. Support your local artists & zines! Thank you.
A post shared by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@ocasio2018) onJul 11, 2018 at 4:58pm PDT
She not only said she was a feminist, her platform was also an intersectional feminist’s dream: She pledged to fight for universal health care, inclusive housing policies, gun control, free post-secondary tuition, criminal justice reform and legislation (like the Equality Act) that safeguards the LGBTQ community. She wants to abolish ICE. And when she talked about women’s right, she was talking about all women’s rights—”Black women, Native women, poor women, immigrant women, disabled women, Muslim women, lesbian queer and trans women,” as it specified on her campaign website.
Honestly, her policies sounded like they belonged in a goddamned utopia. And you guys? She won .
Ocasio-Cortez not only beat longtime Democratic rep Joe Crowley in New York’s congressional primaries in June, making her the Democratic candidate for New York’s 14th congressional district in November’s midterm election. She also won the midterm election with 78% (!!!) of the vote.
When I saw the news, I legit had a moment. I’ve never, in my entire life, ever harboured even the tiniest desire to be a politician—and yet, Ocasio-Cortez’s win made me think it was something I could do if I wanted to. We may not share an ethnicity or cultural background, but I saw myself in her, and it reminded me yet again just how much #RepresentationMatters.
(Photo: GIPHY)
Representation will continue to be part of her story—when she takes office on January 3, she’ll be the youngest woman elected to Congress, and one of the few women of colour. (After this year’s election, there are more women and POC than ever before, but still: of the 325 women who have served in the U.S. Congress to date, only 65 have been non-white.)
But that’s not the only reason Ocasio-Cortez is my fave feminist of the year. I love that she doesn’t allow anyone to undermine her. Remember when she called out conservative writer Richard Scarry for his tweet about how she doesn’t “look like a girl who struggles”?
Oh, does @eScarry think he can delete his misogyny without an apology? I don’t think so. You’re a journalist – readers should know your bias. pic.twitter.com/2KJuiPsUR2

He was trying to imply that she was a hypocrite or a liar, albeit in the dumbest way possible. (Even us poors wear cute clothes, bro.) She wasn’t standing for it. She never stands for people trying to tear her down—about her clothes, her childhood home, her finances, even her recent decision to take a self-care break. I stan for Michelle Obama, but sometimes I don’t want to go high—I want to clap back. And AOC’s clapbacks against misogyny and condescension are legendary.
My new favourite pastime is watching @Ocasio2018 shut-down old, conservative, white men with – WAIT FOR IT – smarts and truthiness. https://t.co/RSspX4aeMg — Natasha Madison (@natmadis) November 19, 2018
I love that she made friends with other progressive members of Congress, including Boston’s Ayanna Pressley, Minnesota’s Ilhan Omar and Michigan’s Rashida Tlaib, because I am forever here for a girl gang, especially one that gets shit done.
I love that she doesn’t hide who she is, despite all the criticism. And that’s not just because having the confidence to be yourself—to reference Hogwarts and use internet-approved turns of phrase in IG captions and also, oh yeah, speak your language unapologetically—is badass. It’s also because Ocasio-Cortez being herself has the power to change Congress. As Alexa Kissinger wrote in Vox, she and her progressive peers are “showing that we don’t have to change ourselves for these institutions. It’s time the institutions changed.”
I love that she has literally no time for Donald Trump.
(Photo: GIPHY)
But the thing I love most is the way she unapologetically owns her successes, something that so many women (myself included) feel uncomfortable doing. In July, after her primary win, she told The New Yorker ‘s David Remnick, “I didn’t edge anybody out. I dominated . And I am going to own that.” That attitude is making a lot of people incredibly uncomfortable. “Ocasio-Cortez’s eagerness to flex her muscles, without demurring or waiting for her turn—without even waiting to be sworn in—is undergirding nightmarish fears about her as an agent of chaos and destruction,” Rebecca Traister recently wrote in The Cut. “What’s scary to so many about Ocasio-Cortez is that she’s acting like a politician with power .”
But I’m not uncomfortable. And I’d hazard a guess that other millennials, especially women of colour, aren’t either. Instead, we’re in awe and, more importantly, inspired.
Also, she’s equally adept at rocking a red lip and the #nomakeup lewk, and I appreciate the flex.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sets Twitter on fire with J.Lo reference

Full text: Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Wednesday reached back into the early 2000s musical archives, tweeting a reference to a 16-year-old hit from pop icon Jennifer Lopez.
Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old rising star in the Democratic Party and Boston University alum, posted a photo of the new plaque outside her congressional office that bears the rookie lawmaker's name and home state of New York, where she pulled off a stunning primary upset en route to a general election victory in November.
“Don't be fooled by the plaques that we got," Ocasio-Cortez wrote above the photo of the plaque. “I'm still / I'm still Alex from the Bronx."
Listeners of a certain age will note the message bears a striking resemblance to the refrain of J.Lo's 2002 smash “Jenny from the Block," in which the singer proclaims, “Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got/I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the Block."
By early Wednesday afternoon, some 43,000 people had liked Ocasio-Cortez's homage to Lopez, a Bronx native whose studio release “Second Act" is currently playing in theaters nationwide.
Lopez hadn't responded publicly to Ocasio-Cortez's tweet as of 1 p.m. Wednesday, following a string of retweets the singer put out the day before from fans posting rave reviews of her new movie.
Earlier this month, Ocasio-Cortez returned to Massachusetts for an orientation program for new members of Congress at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and joined a pre-event demonstration for universal health care and climate change legislation.
“We need to shake this nation awake," Ocasio-Cortez said during the protest.
Days later, she was criticized on social media by Curt Schilling, the former Red Sox hurler and outspoken conservative.

Office Nameplates Go Up, Incoming Lawmakers Get Giddy

Full text: Lawmakers admired their new digs coming together this week as Hill workers posted nameplates outside offices.
Newcomers picked their offices back during orientation and got to tour them, but they still had someone else’s name out front. This week the traditional plaques with new member’s names and districts are being installed outside their offices. And the freshman class of the 116th Congress is psyched.
“It’s kind of fun to do the impossible,” tweeted Joe Cunningham, citing a famous Walt Disney quote along with a photo of his new office nameplate.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez gave a shoutout to another woman from the Bronx who rose to stardom in her field, Jennifer Lopez. Ocasio Cortez tweeted out some personalized lyrics to the JLo classic “Jenny from the Block.”
“Don’t be fooled by the plaques that we got, I’m still / I’m still Alex from the Bronx,” she posted along with a photo of her office plaque.

— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) December 27, 2018
The next line of the JLo hit is “Used to have a little, now I have a lot /No matter where I go, I know where I came from.” She also posted a photo of an Architect of the Capitol employee hanging the plaque on her Instagram.
Parts of the federal government are shut down, but because the funding for the Legislative Branch was already signed into law, agencies like the Architect of the Capitol, Capitol Police and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House are still hard at work getting Capitol Hill ready for the new Congress.
Incoming Mainer Jared Golden retweeted Maine statehouse reporter Steve Collins, who posted photos of Golden’s nameplate along with the interior of the suite and the future view from Golden’s office window.
This is where some of @golden4congress' staff will sit, a pretty typical Capitol Hill arrangement. Thanks for the shot, Mark Hancock! pic.twitter.com/tp9f2Tpxip
— Steve Collins (@SteveCollinsSJ) December 26, 2018
Most members-elect aren't in town yet, but they got creative in how they showed off their new offices. Jason Newton, incoming communications director for Connecticut's Jahana Hayes, took a selfie with the new signage that Hayes shared.
When you call your staff because you heard that DC signs were up and your Comms Director @JNewt1 jogs over to take a pic. Best DC staff ever!!! pic.twitter.com/EcQp5XefMV
— Jahana Hayes for Congress (@JahanaHayesCT) December 27, 2018
Lawmaker’s won’t get access to their offices until the new year, but that hasn’t tamped down the excitement.
Earlier this month California’s Katie Hill offered to swap offices with Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts to bring true Pressley’s dream of working in an office once occupied by the first black woman elected to Congress, Shirley Chisholm.
Wow! TY Mommy for the extra bday luck! We just learned my Congressional Office designation will be #ShirleyChisholm 's former office. How's that for divine intervention, AND the selflessness of my colleague @KatieHill4CA who drew a better lottery# but still wanted me to have it.

Mediaite: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Responds to Comments from Claire McCaskill: 'Pretty Disappointing'

Full text: Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded today after comments about her from outgoing Democratic senator Claire McCaskill . McCaskill gave an interview to CNN this week wherein she said Republican lawmakers privately admit President Donald Trump is "nuts," but she also made news in questioning why Ocasio-Cortez is "the thing" and "a bright and shiny new object" for Democrats.
"I'm not sure what she's done yet to generate that kind of enthusiasm," McCaskill said, "but I wish her well."
She also suggested that Ocasio-Cortez's message may not necessarily resonate with voters in states like Missouri.
Ocasio-Cortez responded on Twitter today, calling McCaskill's comments "disappointing" and saying what Republicans admit in private means nothing:
Not sure why fmr Sen. McCaskill keeps going on TV to call me a "thing" and "shiny object," but it's pretty disappointing.
McCaskill promised she'd "100% back Trump up" on his anti-immigrant rhetoric & lost. In MO, almost all progressive ballot issues won. https://t.co/53qKvnr8KG
-- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) December 29, 2018
In fact, I actually went to Missouri after my primary. I met w Ferguson activists + progressive organizers.
A conservative even came to embed at one of our rallies there. You can tell she was inspired + struggled w/ Fox News bc our message resonated:pic.twitter.com/P0ywHxhC4V
-- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) December 29, 2018
I'm also not sure why McCaskill is covering for the GOP by saying they "secretly think Trump is nuts".
Nobody cares. Trump is melting down our institutions and inciting division between people. At any time GOP could have checked him and choose not to.
They're accomplices.

But what if income wasn't what Ocasio-Cortez was alluding to... what if she was simply hinting to her background as a COLLEGE POP STAR?!
[embedded content]
Seems like a long shot, but a few seconds of that leaked video of Ocasio-Cortez cranking it up with her 'Brat Pack' at Boston University may be enough to convince anybody she had that 'Jenny from the Block' spirit all along. Perhaps she aspired to become a pop star star before she ever got involved in politics? Only one way to find out.

In light of all the hullabaloo over her resurfaced dancing video, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just trolled her critics by releasing a new one. The newly-installed Congressional Democrat just posted a video of herself on Twitter dancing to Edwin Starr 's "War" in front of her office.
"It is not normal for elected officials to have a reputation for dancing well and I'm happy to be one," Ocasio-Cortez told The Hill on Friday. "I think it is just funny what is considered to be disqualifying. It is unsurprising to me that Republicans would think having fun should be disqualifying or illegal."

'Impeach the motherf-----': Newly elected Democratic congresswoman vows to come for Donald Trump

Publication info: Telegraph.co.uk ; London [London]04 Jan 2019.

http://libproxy.usc.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2163284297?accountid=14749

Full text: A newly elected Democratic congresswoman has vowed to impeach Donald Trump, the US president, in an expletive-laced speech that has provoked outrage among Republicans.
Rashida Tlaib, who was sworn in on Thursday, said "we're gonna impeach the motherf-----" during a celebration party with supporters.
In a clip of the event circulated widely on social media on Friday, Ms Tlaib can be heard telling a crowd: "People love you. And you win.
"And when your son looks at you and says, 'Momma, look you won, bullies don't win.' And I said, 'Baby, they don't,' because we're gonna go in there and we're gonna impeach the motherf-----."
The US president responded in a tweet on Friday morning, saying: "How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong ... and is the most popular Republican in party history?"
He added: "They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!"
Ms Tlaib, who represents a heavily Democratic district in Michigan, has defended the comments, saying "I will always speak truth to power".
"This is not just about Donald Trump. This is about all of us. In the face of this constitutional crisis, we must rise," she tweeted.
The congresswoman is a member of the ethnically diverse, progressive wing of the Democratic party which was sworn into the new Congress on Thursday.
The Justice Democrats group, which includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest ever congresswoman, and Ilhan Omar, the first member of Congress to wear a hijab, calls for members to reject corporate donations and describes itself as "working to change the Democratic Party from the inside".
A long-time critic of the Republican leader, Ms Tlaib was once arrested for heckling the then-candidate during his presidential campaign.
The morning of her entry into Congress, she labelled Mr Trump "a direct and serious threat to our country," in a co-authored op-ed for the Detroit Free Press. "We already have overwhelming evidence that the president has committed impeachable offences," she wrote. "The time for impeachment proceedings is now."
Nancy Pelosi, who became the House Speaker on Thursday after Democrats retook control of the chamber, attempted to row back Ms Tlaib's on-camera expletive. Ms Pelosi said "I wouldn't use that language" but added it was "nothing worse than the president has said".
The incident highlights an ongoing tension within the Democratic Party, with the progressive wing pressuring the party's leadership to begin impeachment proceedings against Mr Trump immediately.
Ms Pelosi and other moderate Democrats fear such a move may alienate voters and harm the party's chances of success in the 2020 presidential election. "I do think that we want to be unified and bring people together. Impeachment is a very divisive approach to take and we shouldn’t take it... without the facts," Ms Pelosi told MSNBC.
Meanwhile, an attempt to embarrass Ms Ocasio-Cortez by publishing an old video of her dancing appeared to backfire with social media users praising the 29-year-old congresswoman's moves.
Ms Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has become a lightning rod for conservatives since her shock election victory against a ten-term congressman.
The 30-second video shared on Twitter showed Ms Ocasio-Cortez dancing on the roof of a building in a student production.
Well, @AOC is officially done. She’ll never recover from the world seeing her...

Twitter users responded by sharing their delight and praise for Ms Ocasio-Cortez, who was elected to represent New York’s 14th congressional district in November's midterms.
Actor Russell Crowe said the dance was “fantastic”, and told his followers that “the more politicians we have like AOC the sooner we’ll all be dancing”.
The congresswoman later responded with a video of her dancing in her new office on Capitol Hill. "I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous," she tweeted. "Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too"

Emma Teitel: Dancing while female: it's the latest transgression, according to the Republican playbook

Full text: If you’re going to unearth video footage from a politician’s past and disseminate it on the Internet in an attempt to humiliate her, you might want to make sure that the footage you have is actually humiliating. At the very least, you should make sure it doesn’t flatter the subject.
Clearly this information was lost on the mastermind behind this week’s attempt to embarrass Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, because the supposedly scandalous video of the 29-year-old Democratic congresswoman posted to Twitter on Wednesday is anything but.
You might have seen it.
It’s gone viral.
Not in the way the poster intended.
To summarize, earlier this week, an anonymous Twitter account shared video footage of Ocasio-Cortez dancing on a rooftop, wearing a Boston University t-shirt (her alma mater) accompanied by the following statement: “Here is America’s favourite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is …. High school video of ‘Sandy’ Ocasio-Cortez.”
The Democrat was sworn into congress this week. Whoever posted the footage, and the numerous conservative accounts that shared it, likely hoped it would humiliate the young leader at an important moment in her career and hammer home the message that she is unserious and unfit for leadership.
The problem with their humiliation plot, however, is that, a) the footage is not even remotely embarrassing and, b) it isn’t even from Ocasio-Cortez’s high school years.
In reality, the footage was captured during the congresswoman’s time at Boston University nearly a decade ago (hence the B.U. T-shirt).
If you watch the original video on YouTube, she isn’t dancing by herself … not that there’s anything wrong with that.
She’s dancing with her peers and participating in a viral dance trend popular at the time — one I remember well because I graduated university the same year Ocasio-Cortez did.
In fact, the original video, featuring shots of the Boston skyline, B.U. campus and happy young people in B.U. apparel, almost serves as an advertisement for the school.
But more importantly, this is what the video reveals about the Democratic Party’s fastest rising star:
She likes to dance and she’s good at it.
She seems to have had a great time in university where she participated in wholesome extra curricular activities.
She’s cute.
This isn’t exactly damning evidence of a “nitwit” unfit for public office.
On the contrary, it’s what most people hope for their own children.
So it goes that a plot to embarrass a liberal politician embarrassed only conservative partisans.
In the end, Ocasio-Cortez, an expert in social media outreach, had the last laugh … or rather, the last dance. On Friday, she tweeted out a video of herself boogying in the halls outside her new office: “I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance, too!”
Or rather, wait until they find out what young people among their own ranks get up to.
What’s mind-boggling about this poor excuse for a scandal isn’t so much that some conservative partisan thought the footage would shock and appall the general public; what’s mind-boggling is that in this era, when any young person of any ideological stripe entering politics will have an extensive databank of embarrassing, easy to unearth information about them on the Internet, someone thought this breed of smear attack was a smart idea.
It doesn’t benefit any political operative, political party, nor society at large, to start digging up silly, embarrassing, even scandalous, footage of leaders when they are young … unless of course, what they are doing is criminal.
I don’t care how many keg stands my elected officials did in their youth, and I really don’t care if they danced on a rooftop with their friends. (I do however care if they allegedly sexually assaulted somebody).
If this type of faux-scandal repeats itself, targeting other young leaders, fewer good people will be attracted to politics, and our public offices will be brimming with politicians who either had zero fun in college, or are cunning enough to have scrubbed every ounce of fun from their records (and personally, I trust neither).
Republicans shouldn’t worry about what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did eight years ago; they should worry about what the conservative leaders of tomorrow are doing today.
And they better hope that the most scandalous thing they get up to is dancing on a rooftop in the sun.
Somehow I doubt it.

Ocasio-Cortez now has 1,884,235 million followers, compared with Pelosi’s 1,852,397 million. Other freshman congresswomen, such as Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., lag far behind Ocasio-Cortez, with a comparatively small 370,000 and 183,000 followers, respectively.

Ocasio-Cortez trended on the social media platform on Thursday after now-deleted account “AnonymousQ” shared a video of the congresswoman from her Boston University days dancing like the students who let loose in the movie “The Breakfast Club.”

“Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,” AnonymousQ had captioned the tweet. The video first gained popularity among the populist right and followers of the “QAnon” conspiracy theory. But it soon went viral as many jumped to Ocasio-Cortez’s defense.

In response, Ocasio-Cortez released her own video Friday, which is now the best-performing tweet on her account in the last seven days.

“I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,” she captioned her tweet, in which she dances in front of her office in the Capitol building. “Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!”


The video has since gained over 100,000 shares and garnered almost 500,000 likes.

As for veteran politician Pelosi, her best performing tweet of the week has been a response to Trump’s tweet on the government shutdown.

It has a little over 13,500 retweets and almost 54,000 likes.

Full text: On Wednesday, the night before Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was officially sworn in as the youngest woman to ever serve in Congress, a video of her dancing surfaced online. Specifically, the video showed her and some friends from her undergraduate days at Boston University dancing on a rooftop to Phoenix’s “Lisztomania,” à la this Phoenix/Brat Pack viral mashup video from 2009.
As The New York Times reports, the footage was seemingly shared by a right-wing troll in the latest attempt to embarrass Ocasio-Cortez. “Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,” the account @AnonymousQ1776 tweeted along with an edited version of the original footage. The account has since been deleted.
But if the video was meant to shame her, it backfired spectacularly. “Now she’s totally done for. Newly unearthed video reveals that when @AOC was in college, she was … adorable,” The Washington Post ’s Karen Tumulty tweeted. Patton Oswalt agreed. The Breakfast Club stars Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy invited her into the club. The Twitter account AOC Dances To Every Song turned the video into a great meme. Ocasio-Cortez herself tweeted another video of her dancing outside her new office, which quickly became her most retweeted tweet. And now Phoenix have responded.
“@AOC, Congratulations on being the youngest woman ever being elected to Congress!” the band’s account tweeted early yesterday evening. “Tendrement, Phoenix.” Check out the tweets and the videos below.
@AOC ,
Congratulations on being the youngest woman ever being elected to Congress!
Tendrement, Phoenixhttps://t.co/iJSOSmmCnG@MollyRingwald

Steve Scalise ends Twitter debate with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after attacks from 'radical followers'

Full text: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise put an end to a social media exchange with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., after Twitter users referenced how he was almost shot dead in a politically motivated attack.

"Hi @AOC. Happy to continue this debate on the Floor of the People’s House, but it’s clearly not productive to engage here with some of your radical followers," Scalise wrote, referring to Ocasio-Cortez by her initials.

Scalise's tweet shared images of Twitter users making allusions to how the Louisiana Republican was critically injured in 2017 when gunman James Hodgkinson opened fire on he and his GOP colleagues as they were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game.

"Snipe his ass," one Twitter user wrote.

"She's got better aim than James Hodgkinson, that's for sure," another responded.

Scalise and Ocasio-Cortez had been clashing on Twitter over a CBS News interview with the New York Democrat in which she talks about her plan to fund her "Green New Deal" proposal.

"Republicans: Let Americans keep more of their own hard-earned money Democrats: Take away 70% of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs," Scalise tweeted.

"You’re the GOP Minority Whip. How do you not know how marginal tax rates work?" Ocasio-Cortez replied. "Oh that’s right, almost forgot: GOP works for the corporate CEOs showering themselves in multi-million $ bonuses; not the actual working people whose wages + healthcare they’re ripping off for profit."

Full text: Jan. 07--Shortly after video appeared of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez dancing barefoot on a rooftop when she was an undergrad at Boston University -- video that was supposed to shame the freshman lawmaker, who instead wore it like a badge of honor -- Valentina Rodgers made a prediction.
"I give it 24 hours or less before we get an 'AOC dances to every song' account up with 10k followers," Rodgers tweeted.
And then she made it so.
"Ten minutes later, I'm like, 'Hey, I could do that and get 10,000 followers," Rodgers, 18, told me Saturday from her Arizona home.
As of Monday morning, AOC Dances to Every Song (@aoc_dances) was up to 28,900 followers.
Using the Adobe Premiere video editing app, Rodgers layers the original footage of Ocasio-Cortez dancing to "Lisztomania" by French band Phoenix onto Ocasio-Cortez (known affectionately as "AOC") dancing to dozens of different pop songs.
There's the representative from New York's 14th Congressional District dancing gleefully to "Jenny From the Block!" There she is dancing to "Footloose!" There she is dancing to Rick Astley and Panic at the Disco and The Beatles and Taylor Swift!
"I set it up so that a beat drops when she starts spinning or something to that extent," said Rodgers, who was born in Chicago but moved to Phoenix with her parents when she was 2. "Then I export it and publish it. If I'm really putting my time and attention into it and things don't mess up on my computer, it takes like 5 minutes."
Each clip is just shy of 30 seconds, she said, which has kept her out of hot water, copyright-wise.
"I'm going to keep churning out a bunch until eventually the meme gets run into the ground, which it will do in a day or two," Rodgers said. "Then I'm just going to leave it up as an archive to a moment in internet history."
And what a moment it's been.
Actress Molly Ringwald, apparently charmed by Ocasio-Cortez's "Breakfast Club"-inspired dance moves, tweeted, "That's it, Alexandria you're in the club!"
And a solidly unashamed Ocasio-Cortez sent out a tweet showing footage of her still dancing -- this time outside her new office on Capitol Hill. "I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous," she wrote. "Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!"
Pull out your fainting couches, old guard. Congress is about to look and act a whole lot more like America, and there's absolutely no shame in that.

These Politicians’ Kick-Ass Clapbacks Are All The 2019 Inspiration You Need

The year has just begun, and women politicians are already under fire for swearing at Trump on Twitter. On January 3, New U.S. House Democrat Rashida Tlaib said in a video, “We’re going to impeach the motherf****r” and former Canadian prime minister Kim Campbell tweeted “He really IS a motherf****r.” Some users responded with anger, telling Campbell, for example, to “Stay classy. You’re a former prime minister.” But, if 2018 was the year of women’s rage, then 2019 is shaping up to be the year that women don’t hold back — starting with calling out incompetent, unfit presidents, swears or no. And if they get heat in response? Sometimes, there’s nothing as satisfying as a good comeback. Beginning with Campbell, here are three woman politicians giving a masterclass in how to respond to social media trolls.
Kim Campbell
Called “a cheap stripper” in a tweet that has since been deleted — likely in reference to an iconic 1990 portrait in which she stood behind her Queen’s Counsel robes with her shoulders bare — Campbell assured the poster that, “If I WERE a stripper, I would NOT be cheap!”
I assure you if I WERE a stripper, I would NOT be cheap! https://t.co/VM6dIoNfwT — Kim Campbell (@AKimCampbell) January 7, 2019
Writer and Toronto Sun columnist Tarek Fatah also tweeted that Campbell “once stripped for the cameras while in office” and that it “proves her gutter origins.” He finished by calling it “disgraceful conduct.” Tired from the nonsense, we’re sure, Campbell saucily answered, “I could sue him for libel but then he would have to ask his mother for a raise in his allowance!”

The “leaked” video was meant to discredit her, but AOC laughed it off, tweeting a video of herself dancing at Congress with the caption, “I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!”, further delighting fans.

On a more serious note, Republican campaign strategist Ed Rollins called Ocasio-Cortez a “little girl” on the Fox Business Network’s Lou Dobbs Tonight. She clapped back, saying, “GOP loves to insult my intelligence, yet offers *this* as their best + most seasoned opposition to my policy proposals. If anything, this dude is a walking argument to tax misogyny at 100%.”

Elizabeth May
Green Party leader Elizabeth May set the tone at the very tail end of 2018, hinting at more to come. Jason Kenney, the leader of the United Conservative Party in Alberta, criticized May for her air travel (airplanes have a notably disproportionate effect on climate change) in a backhanded congratulations for her engagement, no less. May quickly set the facts straight and added, “You know me. I walk the talk.”
Jason, You should have asked me. I was at COP24 for work, took the train for 2 days to get to Italy to see my son and daughter in law who are there on Sabbatical. You know me. I walk the talk. Elizabeth https://t.co/rg5ye5LMrc — Elizabeth May (@ElizabethMay) December 30, 2018
Right-wing media personality Ezra Levant also tried to call May a hypocrite because “You and your fiancé have four homes.” May clarified that she in fact, does not own any property and snapped back, “Not the impression you want to create.”
I rent two apartments; One for doing my job in Ottawa. One is my permanent residence in Sidney. I don't own any property. My fiance has a farm and keeps a flat in Vancouver, mostly devoted to the home of his daughter and grandchildren. Not the impression you want to create. https://t.co/nknAzxiwvT — Elizabeth May (@ElizabethMay) December 31, 2018

Former Border Patrol Chief Claims Donald Trump Is Right About The Need For A Wall; Rep. Steve Scalise Under Fire On Twitter For Criticizing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Tax Raise Proposal On The Wealthy; Alex Berenson Discusses His Book Regarding Marijuana And Mental Illness

Full text: TUCKER CARLSON, FNC HOST: Well good evening, and welcome to "Tucker Carlson Tonight". The battle in Congress over the border wall is still ongoing, as you know now in to it's third week.
Large swaths of government remain shutdown, trash remains on the ground. The president says though, he will not give in until he gets funding for a border wall. The president plans to address the country tomorrow night, then he's going to travel to the Mexican border later this week to make his case.
On the democratic side, meanwhile the battle lines remain exactly in place as they were last week they can't allow a wall to be built under any circumstances, they said so many times mainly because of the risk it might actually secure the border.
They can't say that out loud, needless to say -- so they have other story lines. You know how those go, they argue that because walls have worked well for thousands of years, somehow they won't work now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas, they did not cross the border. The solution to that is not a concrete wall, this wall is no deterrent.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By proposing a 5th Century solution, in terms of this medieval border wall for a 21st Century problem.
REP. STENY HOYER (D-MD), MAJORITY LEADER: We don't think the wall is a good technology to do the objective.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Possible that's a coordinating talking point, just guessing. In case it doesn't work, here's another talking point -- walls are just immoral whether they work or not.
(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)
NANCY PELOSI: The inference that you draw from the wall is that's the only way to do that -- that actually is an immorality. It builds walls in people's minds about who should come here.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sure.
PELOSI: It's a very sad thing.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I hate the wall (ph), I think it's immoral, I think it's wasteful.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are we a country that puts a wall between ourselves and an allied nation? A wall is an immoral symbol for our country.
(END VIDEOCLIP)
CARLSON: Just in case you're keeping track on your morality chart at home, walls are moral. More than moral, in fact laudable when they're built in Jordan or Israel, or Tunisia with American backing.
But when they're built here to protect our own population, they are "immoral", OK that's argument number two. Here's argument number three popular with cable news creations like Rick Wilson, "anybody who supports the wall is inbred."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
RICK WILSON: The idea of a physical wall, it -- Donald Trump loves selling this to his base. And again, these are people who are not sophisticated, they are not bright -- they do not understand the complexities.
STEVE CORTES: OK here we go again now with -- yes, here we go with condescending to us in the Trump base.
WILSON: Steve -- Steve, if the shoe fits you've got to wear it.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARSLON: Yeah its complexity, it's kind of -- people who aren't Rick Wilson just wouldn't understand, they're not intellectuals like Rick Wilson. That's what he's telling you on CNN, those are the arguments. What are the actual arguments for and against a wall?
Well we've found someone who has had the difficult job of overseeing protection of the borders, his name is Mark Morgan, he lead the Border Patrol under President Obama. He does not stay for President Trump, he joins us tonight for his view on that. Mr. Morgan, thank you very much for coming on.
MARK MORGAN, FORMER BORDER PATROL CHIEF UNDER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION: Thank you Tuck for having me.
CARLSON: So the idea that walls don't work -- that seems like the most real of the arguments we just heard, do they work?
MORGAN: Yes, they absolutely work. If you look in the past, you don't have to go too far back in history that a bipartisan legislation that was passed -- the Secure Fence Act.
CARLSON: Yes.
MORGAN: In 2006 and 2012 bipartisan legislation passed where they built the wall -- or fence, or physical barrier -- whatever you want to call it.
CARLSON: Right.
MORGAN: It's a wall. It works.
CARLSON: So I just want to be completely clear, I have no idea what your politics are -- you worked for Obama, you did not work for Trump. So I don't know what that says, but just to be totally clear we're having you on to talk about this in your capacity as someone who knows a lot about the subject. Is there a real argument against having a wall, that you're aware of?
MORGAN: No, I don't. And if you look at the experts -- you know, the other day, so both the President of the Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd, as well as the president they were actually -- I was removed as the chief. And I'm here today to tell you.
CARLSON: You were removed as the chief by whom?
MORGAN: By the current administration.
CARLSON: So you were taken out of your job by Donald Trump, but you're here to tell us that a wall makes sense anyway?
MORGAN: Correct.
CARLSON: OK, just to be clear.
MORGAN: That's right, the president is right. The president of Border Patrol Council is right. The other day when they had the national press conference and they got up and they said the wall works, they're right. And it's not based on a personal political ideology, that's based on historical data and facts that can be proven.
CARLSON: So why do you think people oppose it?
MORGAN: You know, that I think is a political point that they're trying to make. I personally, in my experience -- and I was also, the FBI for 20 years, I was special in charge of El Paso Division right on the border.
CARLSON: Yes.
MORGAN: Tucker, I cannot think of a legitimate argument why anyone would not support the wall as part of the multi-layered border security issue.
CARLSON: Right. So it is frustrating to you as someone who's actually done this for a living and as far as I can tell is not political and obviously there's no partisan reason for doing this, is it frustrating how little time we spent actually debating the question of a wall and instead we're debating Trump this, Trump that? But where's the conversation about the actual border and ways to protect it?
MORGAN: Tucker again, I think you're right on. We were too wrapped up in the style, the approach, the fact that it's coming from the current president rather than his substantive issues.
If you look at the substantive issues, the strategy has never changed. From -- from the gatekeeper strategy from years ago, it's about infrastructure, technology, and personnel. That strategy worked then and it works now.
It was approved at the Secure Fence Act in 2006 and 2012 and it works now. I don't understand what's changed.
CARLSON: What do you make of the argument that anyone who thinks the border needs to be secured and there's a crisis. CNN literally put scare quotes around the word crisis today (inaudible) is a bigot. What do you think of that?
MORGAN: Well, then you can me that because I believe in what the president is doing when he says that this is a national security problem, he's absolutely correct. And that doesn't -- doesn't come just from me. That comes from the professionals that have been doing this their entire adult life serving their country on the border protecting its citizens.
They're saying it works. Why aren't we listening to the experts and the people who do it every day? I don't understand that Tucker.
CARLSON: I don't know why we haven't had you on earlier. I -- that's the most compelling case I've seen for this wall. Mr. Morgan, thank you very much.
MORGAN: Thank you.
CARLSON: It's great to see you.
MORGAN: Thank you.
CARLSON: Well, we have saluted to it a minute ago and you've heard it a thousand times, so many it's like background noise now. Walls are racist. They say it constantly. We could give you a thousand examples. We'll just give you one. This is from MSNBC just over this past weekend.
(BEGIN VIDEO)
JASON JOHNSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, THE ROOT: This wall that the president wants is a monument to white nationalism. Anybody who agrees to give any money to this wall is foolish.
(END VIDEO)
CARLSON: Well that was editor of The Root.com, the political editor; Jason Johnson. But hundreds of different people could have said exactly the same thing and have almost word for word.
For the media questioning the racism of Donald Trump's border wall is like questioning gravity. You'd have to be an idiot. That's a -- it's an open and closed case. If you want a wall or any kind of secure border, you're some kind of white supremacist.
What's interesting about this argument and again you hear it everywhere is how Orwellian it is. It's the opposite of the truth. Ask yourself, who exactly supports unrestricted, low-wage immigration?
Who benefits most? If you made a chart, let's be honest here, you'd have to put rich white people at the very top of the list of supporters. Our endless supply of new immigrants gives them, people in my neighborhood, access to much cheaper household help.
Nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, whatever and it makes the products they buy cheaper. Most of all and it makes them virtuous like they're helping the employees who work for them achieve the American dream.
If there's any group in America that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it's not our poor, its people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close.
So what's the flip side? Who gets hurt most by our new borderless country? Well again, not a close call, its African Americans. Here's Cornell economics professor Vernon Briggs quote, because most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market.
And because the black American labor forces so disproportionately concentrated in this same low wage sector, there's little doubt that there is a significant overlap in competition for jobs in this sector of the labor market. Given the inordinately high unemployment rates for low skilled black workers, it is obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers.
In other words, and you already knew this, anyone who thought about it for a second does; low wage immigration is costing African Americans jobs and money. Other studies have reached the same conclusion.
Again, it's obviously true. And because it's obviously true that's exactly why the people benefiting from the current status quo don't want to have this conversation. It's why they scream bigotry until you shut up.
But we won't shut up and instead we're going to talk to Peter Kirsanow. He's a lawyer and a U.S. civil rights commissioner and he joins us tonight. Mr. Kirsanow, thank you very much for coming on as always.
So it just seems to me that this line border walls are racist, secure border walls are racist, you don't like people who look differently from you if you're for it, you're a white supremacist. I mean this is the definition of propaganda given who is hurt by these policies.
PETER KIRSANOW, U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSIONER: Right. It may be an aspect of projection if you're going to give them the best opportunity to describe themselves. And not ascribe to them racism or immorality, which they describe to anybody who wants a secure wall.
And you're exactly right. Professor Briggs testified before the Civil Rights Commission. We had a whole host of people testify in front of the Civil Rights Commission. The one cohort, the one demographic in the United States of America most harmed, most palpably harmed by illegal immigration are black Americans. And politicians -- open borders, politicians know this thing. They know because there have been numerous hearings before Congress on this. I have testified in the number of these hearings. George Borjas has testified in a number of these hearings. Steven Camerota testified and we've presented all of this evidence, all of this data, that the pernicious effect of illegal immigration of open borders has had on black Americans in terms of employment.
Nearly 1 million fewer blacks work today because of competition from illegal immigration than would otherwise be the case if we had a secure border. And it also depresses wages rates by to the tune of $1,800 per year. Gorge Borjas estimates that the depressive effects of illegal immigrates are wages at anywhere from $99 billion to $118 billion annually, cumulatively, but it has the most significant effect on the black community. And then you have the downstream effects from this economic effect.
And that is, you have higher crime rates and incarceration rates, lower marriagability (ph) rates because no one gets married when they're poor and that has the worst effect on the black community, where you've got a 72 percent out of wedlock birth rate in the black community. But it goes even beyond that, if you take a look at crime rates in the black community, we know that in a number of places -- and in fact it's the Obama administration's the Justice Department brought indictments and convictions on the basis of the illegal immigrant crimes games (ph) that specifically targeted black communities.
These were prosecutions by the Obama Justice Department based on racial targeting. Compton used to be 90 percent black and it's now 30 percent black and a large part of that is because of the targeting. Other communities that have suffered the same thing. So if you ask yourself what's racist, I would like to ask members of the congressional black caucus. It's their moniker, they have purportedly assigned this designation to themselves because they have a peculiar interest, with respect to issues pertaining to the black community, ask them about this.
Instead, they've capitulated to the open borders crowd for political reasons; because an influx of immigration or illegal immigrants they believe secures them with the electoral advantage. They've thrown blacks under the bus in the process.
CARLSON: Why does -- you mentioned what has happened in Compton, California. That's at very least, an interesting story. I don't think I've ever read that in the Washington Post or the New York times. why?
KIRSANOW: Because it's contrary to the overriding political narrative, the narrative that says the biggest malady afflicting America today in the era of Trump is white supremacy. Unfortunately, this has saliency only in elevated academic circles. In a real world, that is not true.
What you're seeing on the ground is economic competition, you're seeing crime rates, you're seeing a whole host of things that happened to poor, black folks and other Americans, and the elites apparently are either consciously oblivious to it or unconsciously oblivious to it. But a lot of politicians know precisely what's going on, yet they do nothing about it. And I know they know precisely what's going on because of the testimonies we've given, because of the data we have submitted and they ignore it.
CARLSON: And if you talk about it, they call you names, unbelievable. Peter Kirsanow, it's always great to see you. Thank you very much.
KIRSANOW: Thanks, Tucker.
CARLSON: Congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been in office a very short time, already making news for a push for the 70 percent tax rate. Details on that, after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Newly elected congressman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been in D.C. for just a couple weeks and she's already a prominent fixture. Here, an interview last night with 60 Minutes, she called for big changes in this country, starting with raising taxes to as much as 70 percent on the wealthy. Here's part of it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: But once you get like, the tippy tops, on your ten millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Republican Congressman Steve Scalise of Louisiana criticized that proposal on Twitter and got the kind of abuse you would imagine, comments like, kick his cane. Scalise responded to that this morning on Fox, watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
STEVE SCALISE: A lot of her followers started making some inappropriate references and comments and I said, you know what, I'm not going to have this debate here.
UNIDENTIFIED MAL: Everybody knows you were shot and almost killed, miraculous story that you weren't, thank goodness, and all of a sudden these followers are saying they are going to snipe you. So you got threats. Did she call you or contact you in any way?
SCALISE: No, I haven't heard from her yet.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Lisa Boothe follows this kind of stuff for us. She is an independent women's voice, senior fellow and she joins us.
LISA BOOTHE, FNC CONTRIBUTOR: Hi Tucker, thanks for having me.
CARLSON: So was there a back story there? Have the two of them tangled before? Scalise and Ocasio-Cortez?
BOOTHE: I don't think so but you have to remember too, this interview she did and the calls for increasing the marginal tax rates by 70 percent on those highest earners, have gotten a lot of national attention as you know. So we've had a lot of -- now, she's got also publications asking is this something she should do. I saw repots by Voss, I think CBS ran a story, so now we have all these national outlets, basically having this conversation. I really think Republicans need to take her seriously and realize the impact that she has. She has 2 million something followers on Twitter, and she now as freshman member of Congress, 29 years old, started this national conversation. So Republicans should take her very seriously.
CARLSON: This is exactly what we're going to get it we don't get this moment under control. That is -- I couldn't agree with you more. Are other Democrats starting to mic what she is saying? So you think she's having that affect already?
BOOTHE: I think she will. I honestly do, and I think it's also important to remember, look, she represents New York's 14th congressional district. It's a D-plus 29 district. She's here to stay, unless she gets primaried from the left, she's not going to be beaten by the right. So she's probably going to be around for a while. But I also think what's important for Republicans is to take a step back and ask -- she's essentially asking for this tax increase to solve a problem that's already being solved. So she wants this green deal in an effort to fight climate change, in an effort to reduce carbon emissions, we're doing that on our own.
The United States is the leader in the world in reducing carbon emissions, we're doing that via natural gas, by market forces, by the private sector -- an innovation. And so she's asking to solve a problem that the United States is solving on it's own through innovation in the private sector.
CARLSON: Somebody's better start making that case, I would say in public pretty fast as you can sort of see where this is going, I agree with you.
BOOTHE: And one other thing, Tucker as well -- she's bemoaning corporations but she wants to take this money, likely from tax payers and what they're going to ultimately do is the same thing that President Obama did with the stimulus -- companies like Solyndra. So she's going to continue to feed that corporate welfare and corporate greed, yet she bemoans corporations and corporate greed?
CARLSON: Yeah, I wonder where she is on Google? Interesting question. Lisa Boothe, thank you very much.
BOOTHE: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Great to see you. Well the Ocasio-Cortez interview was interesting and lengthy. Unsurprisingly she thinks the president is a racist, but she also accused him of creating a fake crisis at our southern border, here's part of it.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: Do you believe President Trump is a racist?
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah, yeah -- no question.
COOPER: How can you say that?
OCASIO-CORTEZ: When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where Neo-Nazis murdered a woman -- versus how he manufactures crisis like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders. It's night and day.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Ocasio-Cortez also defended making occasional flubs on factual matters. She accused her critics of having the wrong priorities there.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
COOPER: Criticisms of you is that your math is fuzzy. "The Washington Post" recently awarded you four Pinocchio's."
OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think that there's a lot of people, more concerned about being precisely, factually and semantically correct than about being morally right.
COOPER: But being factually correct is important.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: It's absolutely important, and whenever I make a mistake, I say, "OK this was clumsy." And then I restate what my point was.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
CARLSON: Well speaking of morally correct, author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight. Hey Mark.
MARK STEYN, AUTHOR & COLUMNIST: Hey "Tacka" (ph).
CARLSON: What do you make of that interview?
STEYN: Well you know I actually thought that last point gets to the heart of democrat identity politics. If you are -- the idea to be morally right over being factually correct. If you are going to talk about marginal tax rates, then characterizing it as the "tippy-tops" is actually probably a cute way to sell confiscatory (ph) taxation to large numbers of people.
The whole point about being a democrat, or a progressive, or a socialist is you're nicer than everybody. You have views about minorities, and poor people and all the rest of it -- and it doesn't matter if they devastate the black family, or they admit MS13 gangs -- it doesn't matter. You're essentially advertising your niceness.
And the problem with a lot of democrats is they're not obviously very nice. If you look at Chuck Schumer for example, you can -- he's like -- almost like a stereotypical shark. You can see him polishing his fin as he's talking to you. And the danger for republicans is that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez actually presents these moral issues in a very appealing way, I agree with Lisa on that.
CARLSON: So it's -- I mean, what's the response? I mean, I agree with you completely with Lisa Boothe. I think it's easy to make fun of her, and obviously I enjoy it. But I mean, this could be the future. We'd be (ph) unwise to write it off as a fluke, wouldn't we?
STEYN: Yes, I think so. I mean, she made a very interesting point. As a foreigner I always find those "60 Minutes" interviews horribly over-edited, so they're approximate to no known rhythms of human speech. But she got in a couple of words -- no they are, no you sound like.
CARLSON: You tell it right.
STEYN: This things been on for 50 years and I've no idea why they do it like that. But the whole -- the point where she said, she talked about education and healthcare. America spends more than other countries and gets worse results.
You know that's a conversation -- that's a starting point a lot of people on the right would be willing to share with her. She wants to go in different directions, but her personal story. Her father got cancer and they died, so it's not just you get one lousy cancer and you lose your dad -- she also lost her nice home in the suburbs and her mother had to become a school bus driver. Those are things that ordinary people can relate to.
CARLSON: Right.
STEYN: That story is very common and republicans -- republicans have to be careful. This -- this is not Chuck Schumer. This is not Hillary Clinton.
This is someone -- and we should thank God, by the way, that you have to older than 29 and a half to run for president because otherwise the democrats would have a completely different scale of threat.
CARLSON: Very smart. I agree with that completely. I agree with everything you say, always. Mark Steyn, great to see. Thank you.
STEYN: Now -- now, now Tucker.
CARLSON: It's true.
STEYN: Thanks a lot.
CARLSON: That is spooky. Well, we open this year by calling for conservatives to focus on families above all. And that got a strong response. We'll talk to a critic of our proposal after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
In our opening share of the year, we talked about the central problem of American politics, which is that our leaders have lost sight of the point of being in charge. Their goal should be simple; strong American families. Anything that makes it harder to form strong families.
They ought to be against. It's not complicated. Judging by the response we got, a lot of you agree with that. The peace resonated more than anything we've done in the last two years.
In Washington though, it wasn't very popular. One writer at National Review suggested we were peddling something called victimhood populism. That's missing the point. Populism is never the goal. It's they symptom. Populism is what you get when you blow off the countries problems for so long that voters feel they have to punish the people in charge to get their attention. Populism is a smoke alarm. Ignore it, and the place burns down.
On the left meanwhile, the response was just as predictable. They screamed bigotry, which us always what they do when they don't want you to talk about something. In this case, they accused us of sexism. We dare to talk about the role of falling male wages in the destruction of the American family. That's not allowed.
OK. But let the record reflect that we're not the first ones to notice this phenomenon. There's at least one well known politician who thought deeply about this more than a decade ago. In fact, wrote and entire book on the subject. See if you can guess who that was. All right, time's up. It was Elizabeth Warren.
Back in 2003, Warren was still a Harvard professor. That year, she published a book written with her daughter entitled The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. The central thesis of the book was that the mass entry of mothers in to the work force has been a disaster for families and most of all, for women.
Mothers who work have to spend far more time away from their kids which for many isn't liberating so much as it's deeply sad. Companies love it of course because more workers means cheaper labor. But middle class families, they don't seem happier or more secure then they were a generation ago, if anything, much less.
As Warren points out, you'd think families would be much richer with two parents working. That hasn't happened. Virtually, all the income games have been consumed in an arms race to maintain the status quo. Most things in American life are cheaper than they were 50 years ago, expect for the things that middle class families need most.
Those are all much more expensive. Healthcare, daycare, college tuition, housing in places with good public schools, buying those things now requires two incomes rather than one. That puts a strain on families in which both parents work. It absolutely crushes single parent households.
Warren puts it this way, quote; a generation ago, a single breadwinner who worked diligently and spent carefully could assure his family a comfortable position in the middle class. But the frenzied bidding wars, fueled by families with two incomes, changed the game for single incomes families as well, pushing them down the economic ladder.
To keep mom at home, the average single-income family must forfeit decent public schools and preschools, health insurance and college degrees leaving themselves and their children with a tenuous hold on middle-class dreams.
Such pressures have taken these women out of the home and away from their children and simultaneously made family life less, not more, financially secure. Today's middle-class mother is trapped: she can't afford to work and she can't afford not to, end quote.
Now just to restate, this is not a press release from the Mennonites or a position paper for some Christian right think tank. This was written fairly recently by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the same one, the hero to the left.
Later in the book and we read it, Warren lays out the long-term consequences of an economic system that requires both parents to work. More families go broke. This increases the rate of domestic abuse, divorce and broken homes. Some people simply decide not to have children at all. And Warren's response to that is striking.
Again, another quote from Elizabeth Warren, many view parenthood as nothing more than another lifestyle choice, not so different from joining a commune or developing a passion for windsurfing. But it isn't true for society at large. What happens to a nation that rewards the child less and penalizes the parents?
If middle-class men and women stop making that parental lifestyle choice, who will care for them in their old age? Who will pay taxes, build infrastructure, and keep the economy afloat? And most important, who will populate the great middle-class of America's future, end quote.
Again, and we can't say this enough, Elizabeth Warren wrote that. Not in 1936 but in 2003, the modern era. We had jet planes and frozen yogurt. Elizabeth Warren said that out loud. Nobody seemed to mind. She'd never say that today, it's not allowed like so much else that is true and important.
We'd love to talk to Warren about her book anytime. Obviously she won't come on. She can't talk about the things that she believed ten years ago. No modern democrat can. They can't say they're protecting and encouraging married twp parent families ought to be the goal. That's not their base anymore.
But we can talk about it and we will. And we will celebrate Elizabeth Warren and anyone else who will join us in that conversation. This is not a partisan issue. It is all that matters.
Amy Peikoff is a talk radio host and a frequent guest on this show. She was critical of our segment last week about market fundamentalism. And asked come on and debate and obviously we're happy to have her. Amy, great to see you.
AMY PEIKOFF, RADIO HOST: Thanks for having me back, Tucker.
CARLSON: Thank you. So, our tax code and our regulatory schemes, every single one of them, every tax, every regulation either encourages or discourages human behavior. And since we know that strong middle-class families, independent families, are the basis of democracy and of the market economy for that matter, why wouldn't we do what we can within reasonable limits to support strong middle class families?
PEIKOFF: Well, so what you're talking about there is market intervention. And so when I watched your monologue last week, and kudos to you for starting off the year with a bang Tucker, when I watched that what I saw is that while you and I have a lot of overlap in terms of what are the components of a good life?
What can constitute happiness? We have a different idea of values and in particular what I saw in your monologue, Tucker, is that you're conception of value is lacking one particular aspect that the free market provides for, which is choice.
Values depend on choice. And they depend on them not just because you have to exercise reason and freewill to produce human values. And that's kind of a separate exercise.
But if you take purpose, for example, which you talked about as a component of happiness, purpose is something that if it's going to make you happy for you to pursue a purpose in life, it's something that you choose for yourself.
I mean imagine if the government gives you a list of approved purposes. Every market intervention, the ones that you were talking about in the intro here, you know the regulations and the tax code and everything else, are little bits of force that the government exerts to keep people from making free choices.
And a value requires that you choose it, you know. That that's really, I think, the fundamental difference between you and me.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: What you're saying is -- what you're saying is true that all law; all regulation, all taxes as I said in the intro to my question to you; encourage or discourage human behavior and therefore limit choice.
That's their nature. OK. That's never going to change. So as long as you have a government and you're raising money to run it through the tax code. Why wouldn't you self consciously .
PEIKOFF: Well but -- but here's the thing, I don't -- I don't necessarily think -- I'm not an anarchist and -- but I don't think that a government -- the existence of a government in the long term, you know one a whole lot of people agree with my ideas or, you know, Ram's (ph) ideas; once that happens, you don't have to have involuntary taxation.
Right. What we could do is we could have a pay for service sort of government and, you know, there's proposals about how to do this but it's so far down the road, it's very academic right now.
CARLSON: OK. But I wonder -- here's -- here's the -- look, I .
(CROSSTALK)
PEIKOFF: But it doesn't depend on force is what I'm saying.
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: I was a libertarian for many years. So I -- I know the nature of the fantasy. But I'm -- I'm wondering -- let me just ask you this. You dislike socialism .
PEIKOFF: It seems like a fantasy right now, yes.
CARLSON: And you dislike socialism a lot, of course. And I don't think it works either. We're about to get it. That's very clear. We're going to get socialism. Ocasio-Cortez is famous for a reason and we are acting like the Romanovs, everything's fine.
And that's the reason we're about to get this system that you hate. So wouldn't it be wiser to do what's necessary to bring these forces under control to help people so that we don't get socialism. Does that make sense?
PEIKOFF: Well, I mean so what you're saying is compromised by adding more government controls, controls that you think are going to steer people towards making choices that are probably better for them, you know, in terms of raising good families and things like that. Is that what you have in mind?
CARLSON: I'm saying that any country, any government as long as we're accepting the reality of government and I think for the time being we can agree on that that we have a government that produces a system in which health families are very hard to maintain. It's -- it's a failing system. So why wouldn't we (ph) just be real about that.
(CROSSTALK)
PEIKOFF: Here -- here is the thing. So -- so government should not be initiating force. All it should be doing is protecting peoples' ability to act on their own judgment and exercise their choices about how they best pursue their own happiness, living the good life. That's what it's about. Government cannot make people happy. No -- no market system can make people happy. The iPhone cannot make someone happy.
CARLSON: But it can certainly make them very unhappy and that's what I think our current system is doing and I honestly think both of us will be lamenting the rise of some socialist lunatic very soon.
(CROSSTALK)
PEIKOFF: Sure. But I -- but -- but also where we disagree -- OK, we disagree about that nature of value but also .
(CROSSTALK)
CARLSON: We're out of time. I will give you the last word. (Inaudible).
PEIKOFF: OK. Well we don't have a free market right now and that was the other point I was going to make. So not only do you and I disagree about value and choice but we don't have a free market right now. The ills that you name are caused by government intervention.
CARLSON: Amy Peikoff, always game for a good conversation. I appreciate it. Thank you.
PEIKOFF: Thank you sir.
CARLSON: Well, the people in charge are suddenly for weed. Is it because they're super cool or is there some other reason they might want a passive population. We're going to get some chips and think about it, dude. We'll be right back.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Momentum is building by the day to fully legalize marijuana, 10 states have already done that. More restrictions fall away every election cycle. The federal government barely cares about fighting any of this. You hear less and less about the health risks of marijuana. Does that mean there are no risks? Well, only that may people have an interest in concealing them. Alex Berenson is a former New York Times reporter, he's great novelist, now he's the author of an unexpected new book called "Tell your Children the Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence." He joins us tonight. Mr. Berenson, thank you very much for coming on. I say unexpected because your bio gives no hint of the kind of person who would write this book, but you have. Why did you write it and what did you find?
ALEX BERENSON, AUTHOR AND FORMER REPORTER, NYT: Well, you can blame my wife because she's a forensic psychiatrist which means she deals with the criminally mentally ill. And a couple years ago she said to me, you know, practically every case I see, people are -- people are using cannabis at the time they committed these terrible crimes. And I said to her, that sounds like nonsense, that sounds like reefer madness. And she said you know, maybe you should look at the studies instead of mansplaining me. And I did, and of course you know, never argue with you wife, she was totally right. It turns out there is a proven link between cannabis and psychosis. There's a very, very strong risk that if you smoke too much when you're in your teens, you are more than likely to develop schizophrenia which is really a devastating mental illness for --
CARLSON: It's awful.
BERENSON: Awful, not for just the people that suffered but their families, it destroys families. And furthermore, there's a downstream link between psychosis and violence. So reefer madness basically is real, as a psychiatrist in Australia said to me when I interviewed her.
CARLSON: Do you know how -- let me just pause by noting how uncool you sound by saying that.
BERENSON: I know. You know what, I don't care. Kids, I don't want them to get psychosis, I don't want them to get schizophrenia. I want to tell them the truth. And the reason I wrote this book is so that parents who have kids that might be using can read this and really understand the science is. There is the evidence that if you tell kids about the truth about drug use and about drug addiction and harms, they'll respond. Hopefully this book can help with that.
CARLSON: Policymakers don't seem to have any idea about this or, maybe they don't care. What's your conclusion?
BERENSON: My sense is they don't have any idea. The legalization community has been very, very aggressive about yelling reefer madness at anybody who tries to bring this up. And the science is complicated. And look, it took us 30 years to prove that cigarettes cause lung cancer and along the way everybody said, correlation does not equal causation. Well guess what? Those are people saying -- not those people, but there are people saying the same thing right now. You don't have the evidence. There's a huge amount of evidence and the national academy of medicine basically made this point in 2017, and it was ignored. The elite media just really does not want to deal with the harms caused by cannabis.
CARLSON: You've got a lot of guts to write something like that given the world, I'm sure you live in, and I admire that. I'm dead serious. It's a very unfashionable position for someone in your world and my world to have, and so I'm impressed that you wrote this. Thank you very much. I hope it sells a lot.
BERENSON: Thank you, Tucker.
CARLSON: Well, the left across the country is pushing to decriminalize marijuana and, not just that but to decriminalize many different kinds of crimes. Loitering, shoplifting, theft, and tamp down enforcement on those who remain. Richard is Goodstein an attorney, former advisor to Clinton (ph) , he joins us tonight to explain why that's happening. So Richard, I don't want to be cynical, but you have to think, if you're running a country that kind of shafts young people and makes it very hard for them to get married and have kids or even buy a car, maybe you want them to be spaced out and passive, even more if we are going to get schizophrenia. Am I being too cynical in assuming that?
RICHARD GOODSTEIN, ATTORNEY & FORMER ADVISOR TO CLINTON: Are you including states like Utah?
CARLSON: Yes, I am.
GOODSTEIN: So OK, so all these red states that are going -- right.
CARLSON: Politicians are all the same. They want the money, they don't care about the people.
GOODSTEIN: And I'm just curious, are you discriminating between medical marijuana and recreation?
CARLSON: Of course I am. Of course I'm -- I'm sure that there are health benefits from medical marijuana, I'm sure there's a lot about marijuana we don't know, but we know that heavy recreational use which becomes more common when you legalize it, there's no question of that, is really bad for people. So why are we pushing that?
GOODSTEIN: Well first of all, I don't think we should be pushing it, certainly on children. I mean, I take what the -- Alex just said to be true, that we don't want our kids getting to become psychotic. But the fact of the matter is, the amount that people are going to be using is going to be used whether they are -- whether it's legal or not, and better it should be regulated, it should be taxed. We should basically control what it is that they're ingesting and frankly figure out some way to let the free market takeover.
CARLSON: Yes, the free market. So how are you on organ sales? I'm just curious, since you're a free market guy now and you're all about letting people what they want...
GOODSTEIN: I'm not just now, I've actually bee a free market guy for a long...
CARLSON: Good, then where are you on the poor selling their kidneys?
GOODSTEIN: Yes, I'm down with that.
CARLSON: You're down with that? You're OK with that?
GOODSTEIN: Look, the fact of the matter is, obviously that he just said, that Alex just said could be said about alcohol.
CARLSON: Yes.
GOODSTEIN: Why don't we tell our kids about the danger of that too? And we absolutely should.
CARLSON: Well, I agree, but...
GOODSTEIN: And yet somehow or other we've like given up on that one, but somehow or another, we're going to fight this on marijuana. Don't get me wrong...
CARLSON: Just because one is bad doesn't mean the other is good or bad or good. so when Rahm Emanuel, who did really nothing to fix Chicago at all, the city is in worse shape than when he got there, and his final solution is well -- for Chicago is, we need more casino gambling and more weed to raise money for the bottomless pit that is our local government. That really sends a pretty clear message, like I don't care at all about the people who live here, I ate them, I'm trying to exploit them with more addictions.
GOODSTEIN: Well again, other politicians have encouraged gambling.
CARLSON: They have, yes, and they should be ashamed.
GOODSTEIN: Republicans and Democrats. That's not a partisan issue, we can see that
CARLSON: I already said that at the outset. I'm just said it was disgusting, it's totally wrong and nobody ever says that. Why?
GOODSTEIN: I agree, I don't think that gambling is a great positive influence on the country, and I think as far as weed is concerned, the fact of the matter is, what he's trying to do is routinize it, as opposed to -- frankly, let's just talk about the wall just for a second, if marijuana were legal, we would have less crime, we know that, because the bad guys in Mexico would not have the incentive and we've actually -- we've seen that.
CARLSON: So, let me ask you a question since I have the data and it sounds like you don't. Hasn't legalize marijuana eliminated the black market for black-market marijuana? And the answer is no, not at all, actually.
GOODSTEIN: We actually know that by 78 percent, border patrol people -- seizures are down and where it's up, marijuana is moving through the actual border, the entry sites. A wall is not going to stop...
CARLSON: No, because Americans grow better marijuana than
[2050]
GOODSTEIN: Right?
CARLSON: No -- because Americans grow better marijuana than was ever grown in Mexico, that's the truth. It's grown indoors, hydroponically -- it's one of the great success stories of American agriculture, it's just really bad for you -- that's the point. And politicians don't care because they don't care about the people who live here.
GOODSTEIN: Maybe you and I can end on one thing -- can we agree that sort of research and data could actually contribute to.
CARLSON: Yeah.
GOODSTEIN: Why not have it here? We have it elsewhere, I think that would be good. (Inauidble).
CARLSON: I'm always -- I'm always for science -- always.
GOODSTEIN: Good.
CARLSON: OK, unlike the left I believe in science. But, right, we'll continue.
GOODSTEIN: Good.
CARLSON: Richard, thank you.
GOODSTEIN: Of course.
CARLSON: Well the president announced the other day that U.S. troops would be coming home from Syria, but it doesn't seem like they are. That withdraw has been paused. And now the National Security Advisor, John Bolton says that actually they're not coming home. Americans will only come home from Syria when Kurdish forces are safe from attack by Turkey.
Now Turkey is a NATO ally, and that means the U.S. is levying threats against our own ally in NATO. Remember that the next time you hear how crucial this alliance is, it's all very confusing.
And that's why we're grateful to talk to Christian Whiton, a former State Department Senior Advisor in the Trump and Bush administrations, he joins us now. So I'm not here to attack the Kurds, Christian -- but I'm all of a sudden hearing that the wellbeing of Kurdish forces is more important than getting our troops home. When did this become a critical national security imperative?
CHRISTIAN WHITON, FORMER STATE DEPT OFFICIAL: That's an excellent question and I think Bolton may have actually been misquoted by "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post".
CARLSON: I hope so.
WHITON: If you look at what he said, he says just that Turkey ought to consult with us before they do something in where -- in the areas where the Kurds are. But there is definitely a large unseen force here in Washington that wants mission creep (ph).
They want to go from the actual mission which is killing ISIS, something I think we were all on board with, and President Trump sold to the American people and succeed on -- to protecting the Kurds, essentially to creating another Kurdistan de facto state in Syria, just like the one we helped to create in Iraq.
CARLSON: But you've been here so long, and you've worked in a bunch of governments and so you know what's really happening. When the president comes out and says, "we're bring our troops home from Syria," everyone who lives here said that's not going to happen, they're not going to let him do that -- are you joking? And so Bolton got out there be like, "well actually we're putting this on pause," it's like -- it's according to script actually, it's perfect.
WHITON: Right, but I think at the end of the day if you look at what Trump has said, he said we're getting out. And then there was all this talk about, "oh, well you know that's not really what he meant -- it's going to be four months or longer," and then he said, "I don't know where four months came from."
And then today there's this other mission creep (ph) and people also talking about, "well we might want to manage Syria's airspace." The airspace over the Kurds for a while, which is a longtime neo-conservative dream to have a no fly zone in Syria -- that's a long-term commitment, think about the one we had over Iraq went on for over a decade.
But the president actually criticized those two reports in "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post", I hope he sticks to his word -- I hope we get out. That will be very popular with voters, staying in and changing the plan.
CARLSON: Shouldn't someone -- last question, go on TV at some point and explain to us why it's so important to protect the Kurds? I think most people -- educated people even, have no idea who the Kurds are and why they should care? Why all of a sudden has Washington decided this is the most important thing we should do?
WHITON: It's this sort of new form of imperialism we have. You go back and look to the original European imperialism Middle East, Sykes and Picot. A British and French bureaucrats who basically carved up the Middle East after World War I in to these unstable political entities that made no sense.
I mean, that is sort of what is going on in Washington. You're right, this idea that just because we fought in part with the Kurds -- having never made them a specific promise, that we owe them their own de facto state. Which is the implication here, it's nuts. Never been put to the president, never been put to Congress.
CARLSON: We're (ph) the public, it's supposed to be a democracy -- you should have some way of influencing your foreign policy if you're the citizenry, you know?
WHITON: Yes, it's the palace eunuchs (ph) think they know better than the emperor.
CARLSON: I love that. On that sad, but accurate note -- Christian Whiton, great to see you.
WHITON: Thanks Tucker.
CARLSON: Thank you. While a young girl's murder in Houston described as a case of racial terrorism, what's the truth of that? We'll investigate it after the break.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
CARLSON: Well, the horrifying murder of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes in Houston was briefly a rallying cry for activists across the country who said it was an unprovoked act of racial terrorism. It scared people. Now police have made an arrest in that story line is changing. Trace Gallagher has more on that that. Trace?
TRACE GALLAGHER: Good evening, Tucker, even with zero evidence and no motive, the shooting death of Jazmine Barnes was labeled a hate crime by some. An attorney for the victims' families said he believed the murder was racially motivated because the nation is racially charged. Jazmine was in a car with her mom and three sisters on December 30th when a vehicle pulled alongside them and opened fire. The family reported seeing a red truck with a white driver in his 40's.
A description that led to a sketch, and this statement from Texas Democratic Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, quoting "I believe and having written hate crime legislation, knowing the criteria, I believe that this should be looked at as a hate crime." But three days later, New York-based social activists and writers, Shaun King got a tip that the suspect was a 20-year-old black man named Eric Black. King gave the tip to Harris county Sheriff, Ed Gonzalez and Eric black was later arrested and reportedly admitted driving the car, saying his passenger was the shooter.
The potential second suspect is currently being held on drug charges. But critics point out that Shaun King and Sheriff Gonzalez continued tweeting and promoting the white suspect narrative even after the credible tip. And Congresswoman Jackson Lee maintains that her hate crime statement was just fine. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SHELIA JACKSON LEE: Absolutely not. Nothing is irresponsible when it comes to the loss of a precious seven or 8-year-old.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
GALLAGHER: Investigators say that Jazmine's death appears to be a case of mistaken identity. Tucker.
CARLSON: These people are so irresponsible, it's unbelievable. Trace Gallaher, thank you for that clearheaded report, I appreciate it. That's it for us tonight, sadly, we could go on forever. We will be back tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying pomposity, smugness and --

State Street: Albany Lawmakers Eye Campaign Finance Reform, but Activists Want More

Publication info: Dow Jones Institutional News ; New York [New York]13 Jan 2019.

Full text: By Jimmy Vielkind
Reformers are rejoicing that Democratic leaders of the State Assembly and Senate are set to approve a passel of bills to increase voter participation and tighten campaign-finance laws. But there's still a push to go further on some issues, including the creation of a public-matching system to finance campaigns.
About 30 progressive activists rallied at the Capitol before lawmakers opened their sessions last week.They were part of the Fair Elections for New York coalition, a group of 175 labor unions, good-government advocates and progressive groups pushing for a system, similar to what exists in New York City, where small donations are multiplied with public money.
On Friday, a group of 80 business and academic leaders, including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, hedge-fund manager Jonathan Soros, developer Jeff Gural, telecom executive Leo Hindery, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and actor Alec Baldwin wrote to Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders urging them against a nibbling approach to reform issues.
"We do not doubt that you will face pressure to take democracy reform in small steps. We urge you not to rest at remedial measures, but rather to cut a path the nation can follow," wrote the group, NY LEAD, which was organized with the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.
A smaller version of the same coalition was active in 2012, when progressives unsuccessfully pushed for a system of public campaign finance. Republicans, then in control of the state Senate, blocked the system.
That year Mr. Soros along with Mr. Hughes and his husband, Sean Eldridge, spent more than $500,000 through two super PACs to support a Democratic candidate for state Senate.
On Monday, legislators will consider bills to automatically transfer voter registrations when a person changes residence, create a single-party primary election in June -- there are now primaries in June and September -- and amend the state constitution to allow for greater voting by mail.
They also plan to take up one campaign-finance measure: a bill that would require greater disclosure of the individuals behind political contributions from limited liability companies and cap an LLC's aggregate giving to $5,000 per year.
New Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins has previously sponsored bills on public campaign finance. They have not been a priority for Assemblyman Carl Heastie, and have not come up in his chamber since he was elected speaker in 2015. Mr. Cuomo will include a system of public campaign finance when he proposes his state budget on Tuesday, according to senior adviser Rich Azzopardi, as he has for the last six years.
"We're very excited that key voting reforms that are part of the Governor's 100-day agenda will be taken up by the Legislature on Monday, " Mr. Azzopardi said. "We look forward to working with them to go further and enact public campaign financing, make Election Day a state holiday and ban corporate contributions once and for all."
WE'RE FUNDING THE AMAZON FIGHT: State Sen. Mike Gianaris has been consistently speaking out against Amazon.com Inc.'s decision to locate a new office campus in the Long Island City portion of his Queens district, and last month made his case in two taxpayer-funded mail pieces.
"Join the fight against Amazon," screams one flier, which was sent to us by a reader in Astoria. It directs residents to Mr. Gianaris' Senate website to learn about community forums.
The fliers also show tweets from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Zephyr Teachout, a legal scholar and former candidate for governor and attorney general. Both are beloved figures among progressive activists who have mobilized against the Amazon deal and who, political observers say, could threaten the Democratic state senator's electoral left flank.
The mailers were approved last year, when Republicans controlled the chamber. The Senate's guidelines for mail prohibit soliciting campaign contributions or the depiction of party officials. Mr. Gianaris said the pieces met those criteria.
Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio negotiated the deal to land Amazon's headquarters, and the company has promised 25,000 jobs for the area. The Democratic executives have offered up to $3 billion of incentives. Mr. Gianaris' mailer attacks the deal as "corporate welfare."
The Empire State Development corporation helped negotiate the deal and is hiring a $58,500-a-year "Amazon community liaison" to "build community and stakeholder support" for the project, according to a job listing.
A spokesman for the authority said this is routine for large projects, and the liaison will work with a 45-member community advisory council. The New York City Economic Development Corporation is advertising a similar job.
The company, earlier this month, sent its own mailer to Queens households touting the project's benefits, including career training for local residents. "We pledge to be your partner, and to listen, learn and work together," it said.
"This is not a one-way street," Mr. Gianaris said. "Every public dollar spent to promote this awful deal is a scandal. You better believe I'm going to tell this community the other side of the story."
THE QUESTION: Mr. Cuomo recently appointed Letizia Tagliafierro, a longtime counsel and former executive director of the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, to serve as the state's inspector general. Which television star was Ms. Tagliafierro's high-school prom date?
LAST WEEK'S ANSWER: U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer is fond of saying the James Madison High School basketball team's motto was "we may be small, but we're slow." Kudos to the people who wrote us, especially the handful who knew but have never worked for the senator.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave her Democratic colleagues Twitter training

Author: Serfaty, Sunlen; Sullivan, Kate

Publication info: CNN Wire Service ; Atlanta [Atlanta]16 Jan 2019.

Full text: Freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who frequently captures national attention with her social media posts, gave her Democratic colleagues in the House of Representatives a little lesson: how to use Twitter in a more effective way.
Ocasio-Cortez led the discussion along with fellow Democrat, Rep. Jim HimesÂ of Connecticut, on Thursday to "discuss how they use Twitter as an effective and authentic messaging tool to connect with their constituents" and "the importance of digital storytelling," according to a notice sent to Democratic House members obtained by CNN.
"Class was in session this morning! I was thrilled to offer some insights on Twitter and social media to my. colleagues this morning," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Thursday morning.
The progressive freshman Democrat representing New York's 14th District has risen to become one of the most high-profile Democrats in the House. The 29-year-old congresswoman has 2.4 million followers on her campaign Twitter account, surpassing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 2 million followers on her official account. She frequently hits back at critics on the platform and goes viral.
Earlier this month a video of Ocasio-Cortez gleefully dancing when she was in college surfaced on Twitter, where the poster of the clip described the congresswoman as a "clueless nitwit." Ocasio-Cortez shot back at critics by posting a video on Twitter of her dancing in front of her congressional office with the caption, "I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous. Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!" The video has garnered 20.5 million views.
The congresswoman also uses social media to speak directly to constituents and viewers in a way members of Congress have rarely done before. She frequently hosts "Instagram Live" sessions where she answers questions submitted by viewers on the platform. One of Ocasio-Cortez's Instagram accounts has amassed 1.8 million followers.
The congresswoman also gave her viewers a behind-the-scenes look at congressional orientation on Instagram.
The freshman Democrat took office in January after running an efficient grassroots campaign in the Democratic primary where she unseated former Rep. Joe Crowley, who was the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House and a 10-term congressman in New York.
The notice of the scheduled Twitter training was sent out by the chair of the House Democratic Policy & Communications Committee, Rep. DavidÂ Cicilline, and the committee co-chairs, Rep. Matt Cartwright, Rep. Debbie Dingell and Rep. Ted Lieu.
Representatives from Twitter will also be present at the meeting to answer questions and discuss resources for representatives and staff, according to the notice.
A Twitter spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the company hosts trainings with member of Congress and staff "on both sides of the aisle, to ensure legislators are able to leverage the power of Twitter to amplify their message and communicate directly with their constituents."
Representatives from the Franking Office will also be in attendance to "cover the difference between official and non-official accounts and what your office can/cannot post on each account," the notice reads.
This post has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

6 reasons that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the most powerful woman in politics

Publication info: Telegraph.co.uk ; London [London]16 Jan 2019.

http://libproxy.usc.edu/login?url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/2167525681?accountid=14749

Full text: Unless you’ve been living under a rock, or somewhere off-grid, you will probably have heard of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . If you haven't, here are the York Notes: she is the 29-year-old, newly sworn-in congresswoman who is already changing the face of the Democratic Party.
Late last year Ocasio-Cortez made history in becoming the youngest woman to be elected to the US House of Representatives, after beating her longshot Republican opponent Anthony Pappas and winning the 14th congressional district of New York with 78.2 per cent of the vote - a victory which marked the inauguration of a new wave of progressive Democrats.
Born in New York to a father from the Bronx and a mother from Puerto Rico, Ocasio-Cortez grew up in a working-class family. She shuttled between her home and school in the more affluent New York counties - and with this came her first experience of income inequality.
After graduating from Boston University with a degree in economics and international relations, Ocasio-Cortez moved back to the Bronx to help supplement her mother’s income (from being a cleaner and bus driver), by working as a waitress and bartender in Manhattan - a job she had for less than a year before being elected to Congress.
She had some experience in politics - having previously worked for Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts on immigration issues and being an organiser for Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign - but the primary in June 2018 was Ocasio-Cortez's first run for office.
In her campaign video, she said: “Women like me aren't supposed to run for office, I wasn't born to a wealthy or powerful family. I was born in a place where your zip code determines your destiny.”
While her campaign policies, which focused on medicare for all, universal job guarantees and immigration justice (to name but a few), demonstrated the rise of alternative narratives to current mainstream American politics.
Since winning in the 2018 US Midterms, Ocasio-Cortez has continuously proved exactly why her presence in the current political climate is so necessary. And if you haven’t found enough of a reason to love her already, here are five reasons why we can’t get enough of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez...
1) She uses Twitter masterfully
Unlike the President, who uses his cyber presence in such a way that it has now become almost comical, Ocasio-Cortez has honed her position as a millennial politician and shown just how adept she is at using social media to connect with people, while perfectly disseminating her message.
This week instead of Trump and the GOP - who are usually at the receiving end of Ocasio-Cortez tweets - CBS News was put in the spotlight for its apparent lack of black journalists covering the 2020 US presidential election.
It's Official: The @CBSNews 2020 Election Team has assembled! https://t.co/0GBCw4mj7spic.twitter.com/E0rUDAkzf7
- Ben Mitchell (@bfmitchell) January 11, 2019
In a response to CBS producer Ben Mitchell’s announcement of the team covering the upcoming election, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: “This WH admin has made having a functional understanding of race in America one of the most important core competencies for a political journalist to have. Yet CBS News hasn’t assigned a *single* black journalist to cover the 2020 election.”
She added “Unacceptable in 2019. Try again.”
2) She fights back, defiantly
Efforts made by online trolls to humiliate the Democrats’ fastest rising star as she was sworn into Congress at the start of the year, rapidly backfired and proved that Ocasio-Cortez won’t go down without a quick-witted fight.
When a Twitter user called AnonymousQ posted a 30 second video clip of Ocasio-Cortez dancing on a rooftop while in college, with the words “Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is”, Ocasio-Cortez hit back by posting a brand new short video of herself outside her new congressional office dancing to Edwin Starr’s classic War.
I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous.
Wait till they find out Congresswomen dance too! ����
Have a great weekend everyone :) pic.twitter.com/9y6ALOw4F6
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 4, 2019
3) She is not intimidated
There is no question of the conflict between Ocasio-Cortez policies and that of the President. For one, she is an avid campaigner for the abolishment of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) and a strong opponent of current immigration policies spouted by Trump that have seen children separated from their families.
She has routinely sought to call Trump out. During an interview with 60 Minutes, where she was asked if she thought Mr Trump was a racist, she quickly replied: “Yeah. Yeah. No question.” She also supported his impeachment back in June, saying: “I think that, you know, we have the grounds to do it,” citing Trumps violations of the Emoluments Clause.
And in true New Yorker form, when she was asked on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert whether she would be nicer to Donald Trump than former Congressman Joe Cowley, she said: “I don't think he knows how to deal with a girl from the Bronx”.
4) Her response to the government shutdown
When Trump shut the US government down on December 22, after the Democrats refused to approve funding for his promised wall, Ocasio-Cortez responded by declaring that congressional salaries should be furloughed along with federal workers.
She tweeted: “It’s completely unacceptable that members of Congress can force a government shutdown on partisan lines and then have Congressional salaries exempt from that decision. Have some integrity".
Later she added: “The GOP had control of the House, Senate, AND the Presidency + STILL couldn’t keep gov open.That ineptitude means 800k fed workers won’t get paychecks, and have to negotiate with landlords + creditors over the holidays. This isn’t how you treat people”.
5) She is reshaping the conversation
Shortly after her primary election win, Bernie Sanders congratulated Ocasio-Cortez by stating: “She demonstrated once again what progressive grassroots politics can do."
In just a small amount of time Ocasio-Cortez has reshaped the political conversation of her own party and given it a facelift. Her policies, as well as her presence, represent a diverse and inclusive Democratic party, willing to fight on issues too often considered as ‘radically liberal’.
6) She values self-care
In December, Ocasio-Cortez took a week long 'self-care' break ahead of being sworn in:
She revealed that before campaigning, she did yoga up to four times each week and ate healthy home-cooked meals. During the campaign, however, she didn't have time for yoga and found herself eating fast-food.
I’m taking a few days to take care of myself before what is sure to be an eventful term.
For working people, immigrants, & the poor, self-care is political - not because we want it to be, but bc of the inevitable shaming of someone doing a face mask while financially stressed./1 https://t.co/EWdWFmPwet
- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) December 17, 2018
Ocasio-Cortez ended up in the 'middle of nowhere' in upstate New York, with her music, lavender oil and Epsom salts for company.
We applaud anyone who isn't afraid to show their human side - all too rare in politics - and who knows the importance of avoiding burnout. And we can't wait to see what she does next.

@AOC schools the GOP on how progressive taxes really work

Full text: In my mind's eye, former Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker was chuckling softly and flexing his fingers Tuesday morning as he prepared to hit send on a tweet mocking a tax proposal recently floated by newly elected Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.
In an interview that aired Jan. 6 on CBS' "60 Minutes," Ocasio-Cortez floated the idea of federal income "tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent" when asked what she thought a "fair-share" rate would look like for wealthier Americans.
This touched off a flurry of indignation, scorn and contempt from the right, a flurry to which Walker added with this salvo on Twitter:
"Explaining tax rates before Reagan to 5th graders: 'Imagine if you did chores for your grandma and she gave you $10. When you got home, your parents took $7 from you.' The students said: 'That's not fair!' Even 5th graders get it."
It's perfectly possible that fifth-graders would be fooled by this kind of sophistry. What do they know? If a former governor who was at one time thought to be presidential timber tells them that prior to the term of Republican President Ronald Reagan (1981-89) the federal government took 70 percent of what a person earned, well, he wouldn't lie, would he?
Well, kiddies, he would. And he did.
In 1980, a fifth-grader whose allowance was less than $44 a week would have owed no tax at all on the 10-spot grammy paid for doing chores. And he or she would have had to have a weekly stipend of more than $2,000 a week before the 70 percent rate kicked in on that extra $10.
In between there were more than a dozen income thresholds -- call them "brackets" -- above which each additional dollar earned was taxed at a slightly higher rate.
The spunky, defiant Ocasio-Cortez, widely known as "AOC," her initials and her Twitter handle, explained it well on "60 Minutes" -- "Your tax rate, let's say from zero to $75,000, may be 10 percent or 15 percent," she said. "But once you get to the tippy-top -- on your 10 millionth dollar -- sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more."
In other words, if, under her hypothetical scenario, you make $10 million, you're not paying a 70 percent tax on all $10 million, as Walker told the fifth-graders in his anecdote. You're simply paying 70 percent on every dollar of taxable income above $10 million. All the other money you've earned is taxed at a combination of the lower rates.
Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik did the math and noted that if we added the 70 percent bracket Ocasio-Cortez proposed to today's brackets, which top out at 37 percent, "a taxpayer with income of, say, $11 million would have an overall tax rate not of 70 percent, but about 39.5 percent."
Radical? Outrageous? Setting aside philosophical arguments about morality and taxation, no. It was simply ordinary for half of the last century. The top marginal federal income tax rate (the rate paid by the highest earners) rose to 63 percent in 1932, spiked at 92 percent in 1953 and didn't fall to pre-1932 levels until 1982.
Somehow the country and the wealthy not only survived, but thrived, even though, in 1980, the top rate kicked in at earnings over $108,000 (that's roughly $350,000 in 2018 dollars), not $10 million. Indeed, these were the decades of health for the middle class to which many of those who say they want to "make America great again" refer.
Ocasio-Cortez dunked on Walker three hours later Tuesday in a tweet of her own in which she used the Spanish word for grandmother:
"Explaining marginal taxes to a far-right former Governor: Imagine if you did chores for abuela & she gave you $10. When you got home, you got to keep it, because it's only $10. Then we taxed the billionaire in town because he's making tons of money underpaying the townspeople."
Steeply progressive taxation makes a society and an economy better and stronger. Fifth-graders may not get this, but most economists and most adults do.
A poll taken last weekend by The Hill-HarrisX found 59 percent support for taking income over $10 million at 70 percent. A 2017 Reuters-Ipsos poll found 76 percent of respondents agreeing with the proposition that "the wealthiest Americans should pay higher tax rates," with 53 percent expressing strong agreement.
In Illinois, where newly elected Gov. J.B. Pritzker has promised to work to overturn the state constitutional ban on graduated state income tax rates, 76 percent of respondents to a Paul Simon Public Policy Institute poll expressed support for an extra 3-percent tax on income over $1 million, and 72 percent gave a thumbs-up to the idea of graduated income taxes.
Conservatives who have pushed down top marginal tax rates and expressed nonchalance about the subsequent massive growth in the wage gap have so far kept such initiatives at bay. They've done this in part by branding high marginal rates as socialism, and in part by peddling the falsehood -- to children, no less! -- that the rates apply to every dollar earned.
They are meeting their match with the fiery Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

In three short weeks in office, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has shaped a national conversation on taxation, emerged as the face of a green jobs plan in Washington and elevated her initials into a worldwide brand.
But she has not yet opened an office in her own New York City district -- a delay that may give a sense of her priorities early in her tenure.
During an appearance on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" on Monday, she blamed the government shutdown.
"There's a lot of things we can't do as freshmen members," she told Mr. Colbert as they ate spoonfuls of ice cream. "We can't properly set up our district offices. We can't get laptops delivered. We can't start doing the work that we were elected here to do."
"It takes the green stuff," she said. "And those workers are furloughed."

But the shutdown has not had a similar effect on other first-term Congress members from New York State.
Of the four who took office on Jan. 3, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is the only one who has yet to open a district office. (A fifth freshman, Representative Joseph Morelle, has also opened a local office, but he took office in November after a special election and therefore had more time.)
"We haven't really run into any issues via the shutdown," said Jonas Edwards-Jenks, a spokesman for Max Rose, a Democratic representative from Staten Island. Mr. Rose unseated a Republican incumbent, Dan Donovan, and moved into Mr. Donovan's former district office. "We took that office over and were able to have that open on Day 1," said Mr. Edwards-Jenks.
The shutdown did not stop Representative Antonio Delgado from opening his first local office in Kingston, N.Y., within two weeks of taking office. Nor did it stop Anthony Brindisi, a freshman representative in upstate New York, from opening two offices.
"No issues due to the shutdown," said Macey Matthews, a spokeswoman for Mr. Brindisi. "Our Binghamton office opened on Jan. 3, and our Utica office officially opened yesterday," she said in an email last week.
District offices often function as one-stop service centers for constituents, and in Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's district, the congresswoman's staff would have been able to help with imminent problems like deportation and more mundane concerns like airplane noise from nearby La Guardia Airport.
Instead, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that constituents have been redirected to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand's office since "prior to our swearing-in," and that she was thankful for "continued assistance" from the senator's office.
For Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, finding a balance between the unique national platform she has attained as a new member of Congress and the workaday realities of what members call "case work" back home has been on her mind since the start. Among the videos she posted during her first days in Washington at a so-called Congress camp after her victory last year is a poll in which she asked where her focus should be.
"Would you rather have a Congress member with an amazing local services office, or one that leads nationally on issues?" she queried her 1.9 million followers on Instagram -- a number that is well over twice the population of her district. The results strongly favored national issues.
Her district, New York's 14th, includes sections of the Bronx and Queens and is among the most ethnically diverse in the country, a place where local and federal officials said they dealt daily with constituent concerns over immigration, Medicare, Social Security and veterans benefits among other issues. Joseph Crowley, the former Democratic power broker whom Ms. Ocasio-Cortez defeated in June, dealt with at least 370 constituent cases in his last full year, according to a Twitter post from his office at the time.
While Ms. Ocasio-Cortez blamed the shutdown for her delay in opening a district office, the General Services Administration, which helps with the setup of such offices, said those services were not affected by the shutdown. But General Services could not deliver office supplies -- including laptop computers -- to a district office that has not been opened.
The reality may be much more local: Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's decision not to take over Mr. Crowley's Jackson Heights, Queens, office complicated her office setup. (He also had an office in the Bronx.)
"If you're inheriting your predecessor's offices, that can be relatively seamless," said Bradford Fitch, the president of the Congressional Management Foundation, a nonprofit that helps lawmakers and their aides. "Opening up a new office has all of the challenges of opening up a new business, along with the red tape." A month or two for a member changing offices would not uncommon, Mr. Fitch said.
No new leases could be signed before Jan. 3, but the office could begin making arrangements, Mr. Fitch said. "I'm pretty sure that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was not going to be beat in a general election. So I'm sure they had more time to plan," he said.
After receiving questions from The Times about the district office, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez used her official House Twitter account to explain that she did not take over Mr. Crowley's office because the landlord had wanted to nearly double the rent. The landlord could not immediately be reached.
In recent days, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has secured a space along 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights, about eight blocks away from Mr. Crowley's old office. That office is not expected to open until at least March. Her website describes it as "under construction."
In the meantime, her communications director Corbin Trent said, some of her staff were working out of the Bronx office of a newly elected state senator, Alessandra Biaggi.

YORKTOWN
Search for this town on Twitter, after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's high-profile election to Congress, and one posting called it "a very swanky suburb." It's "one of the richest New York suburbs," another person tweeted. Ocasio-Cortez, who made the Bronx the cornerstone of her personal story during the campaign, graduated from Yorktown High School in "the wealthy and privileged Yorktown Heights," said a different tweet. Democrat Ocasio-Cortez has become something of a social media sensation with her statements on various issues and her support for universal health care and taxing the wealthiest Americans.
But whether her upbringing was more about the Bronx, where she was born and which she represents in Washington, or suburban Yorktown, where she later moved to in the 1990s and attended school, has drawn controversy.
The result is daily social media banter that portrays Yorktown as a gilded place, perplexing some in town. Before Ocasio-Cortez took office, Yorktown's only national reputation was that of a lacrosse powerhouse.
"We're probably right in the middle — we're not affluent," said Town Supervisor Ilan Gilbert. "I would not put us in the same category of Chappaqua or Larchmont or Purchase."
Housing prices bear that out, relative to parts of the rest of Westchester County.
Yorktown's median home value is $570,800, according to Zillow, and the top five homes listed for sale recently in the Yorktown Heights hamlet range from $975,000 to $1.4 million. Four homes are listed above $1 million.
Compare that to Rye, where the median house value is more than $1.7 million and the top five listings range from nearly $8 million to $13.6 million. Twenty homes are listed for more than $4 million.
In Scarsdale, the median home is $1.5 million and the top five listings range from $4 million to about $6 million. Chappaqua's median home value is $843,600 and the top five listings span $2.5 million to $5 million.
Yorktown falls farther down the list if you include pricey commuter suburbs in Bergen County, New Jersey, Fairfield County, Connecticut, and on Long Island's North Shore.
The neighborhood where Ocasio-Cortez's family lived features split-level single-family homes and capes, several of them 1,800 square feet or less, according to Zillow listings. Homes on the market in the neighborhood tended in recent years to list or sell in the mid- to high-$300,000 range.
Gilbert, who remembers his daughter going to play dates and sleepovers with Ocasio-Cortez when they were children, said the town's median income — $115,732 in 2017, according to census figures — seems higher because there are a lot of households where both parents work. It's also a town that's home to many public employees, such as police officers, he noted.
Ocasio-Cortez could not be reached for comment after efforts to contact her spokesman over several days.
She and her family lived in the Bronx's Parkchester area when she was 2 years old when her father purchased the home in Yorktown for $150,000. The family moved there several years later. Ocasio-Cortez graduated from Yorktown public schools in 2007 and then went to Boston University.
She was living at the Yorktown address with her mother and brother in 2016 when they sold the home for $355,000.
Yorktown is 39 square miles, consists of several hamlets, has more than 36,000 residents and its population is about 90 percent white. Some popular spots include a Starbucks and Turco's grocery.
"Yorktown's not considered a wealthy town," said Dan Strauss, a resident for 52 years. "There are some people here who have money, OK, but there are also 5,000 seniors, many of them not well to do."
In Westchester, it's a fair rule of thumb that the easier the commute to Manhattan, the higher the home prices, and the higher the household income. Yorktown does not have a Metro-North stop. Instead, city commuters drive to Croton-on-Hudson, Peekskill or perhaps Mount Kisco and pay a nonresident premium for parking at those stations.
Resident George Wallace chuckled at the mention of Yorktown as wealthy bastion.
"We bought a small two-bedroom house because it was our first house, and still is — we had to keep on moving north (to Yorktown) to find something we could afford," he said.
Wallace grew up in a section of Brooklyn long before much of that borough saw the price surges and redevelopment of recent years.
"I would say it's middle, upper-middle class," Wallace said of Yorktown. "But I wouldn't go affluent. If it was affluent, I wouldn't be living here."
But resident Darlene Russell said the town is affluent compared to some communities, and some people she encounters see it that way. It also depends where in Yorktown people live, she said.
"Certain hamlets of Yorktown, it might be very different," she said.
Russell questioned whether a candidate of a different background would come under the same scrutiny for her residency that Ocasio-Cortez did.
"We still have to deal with a society where we have created this race-based, gender-based, class-based paradigm" across the country, she said.

Meme called racist included in GOP letter

Full text: An email sent by the Williamson County Republican Party contained what some are calling a racist meme featuring U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a newly elected member of Congress who is quickly becoming a target of criticism for Republicans.
The image shows a woman interviewing Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y, asking her opinion on Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that affirmed a women's right to have an abortion.
The lawmaker is shown responding, "Thats (sic) the only two ways Mexicans can cross the river."
The image appears to have been included at the bottom of a newsletter sent by Debbie Deaver, chair of the Williamson County Republican Party, and comes amid the five-week partial shutdown of the federal government and increasing tensions surrounding immigration and President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.
In an email to The Tennessean on Tuesday, Deaver defended the decision to include the image in an official party newsletter.
"Allowing a few people on the left to whip up media outrage over political satire is just another example of the left manipulating the press to present their narrative as truth and all other views as wrong or worse racist," Deaver said in the email.
"The Republican Party of Williamson County will not let those outside our organization tell us what we can or can't say."
Williamson County School Board member Eric Welch, a Republican, spoke out against the image on his official Facebook page Monday in a post addressed to Deaver.
"The text suggested it was meant to be humorous. It absolutely was not," Welch wrote. "It wasn't funny, or clever and it certainly wasn't worthy of the party of Lincoln. Speaking as a Republican, this doesn't represent me or my beliefs."
Williamson County Democratic Party Chair Holly McCall said Tuesday that the image was sad, but not surprising.
"This is a tired, old racist joke that the Williamson County Republican Party has now shopped around in meme form, additionally attacking a Democratic congresswoman," McCall said. "It's not even shocking to see something like this coming out of (the party). Instead of addressing issues, they would rather take the low road."
Deaver said the decision to include the image in the email newsletter comes down to freedom of speech, and added that no one from the party has complained to her about the image.
"While the Williamson County Republican Party respects the rights of all individuals and we stand united by the Republican Party platform as a big tent where all are welcome, we do grant our members the platitude to decide for themselves what offends them," Deaver said.
Gov. Bill Lee spokeswoman Laine Arnold declined to comment on the matter. Lee, a Republican who was inaugurated Saturday, is a Williamson County native.
It's unclear exactly when the newsletter containing the image was sent out.
As for Ocasio-Cortez, Deaver said the new congresswoman and rising political figure is going to be the subject of satire — some of which may be found offensive or humorous to different people. Ocasio-Cortez, who is of Puerto Rican descent, has quickly built a reputation as a firebrand in Congress with a strong social media following, drawing the ire of numerous high-profile Republicans.
Deaver claimed no one on the left has complained after Ocasio-Cortez said in a recent Washington Post interview that Democratic Congress members plan to "run train" on the progressive agenda over the next two years.
The comment has been perceived by some as a reference to gang rape.
While the Williamson County Republican Party keeps a relatively low profile, the November 2018 general election solidified the county's reputation as a GOP political stronghold. In addition to Lee, state House Speaker Glen Casada and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, both Republicans, are also Williamson County residents.

'Let’s bury the hatchet': Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Lindsey Graham trade barbs on Twitter

Full text: WASHINGTON – Another day, another fight in Washington.
Freshmen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is known for her feisty social media presence, got into a quarrel on Twitter with prominent, longtime Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday.
The pair got into a back-and-forth about the government shutdown, the State of the Union and some of the Democratic socialist ideas that Ocasio-Cortez has proposed.
The quarrel started after Graham issued a statement, saying that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to uninvite President Donald Trump from giving his State of the Union address was a "new low for American politics. "
Ocasio-Cortez chimed in: "According to @LindseyGrahamSC, the President failing to condemn neo-nazis, forcing thousands of federal workers to go to food pantries,& risking all their credit scores is whatever, but not letting the President march down the House Floor until we pay people first is 'a new low. '"
The tweet got 16,000 retweets and got the attention of the prominent South Carolina Republican, who now chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.
More: Ocasio-Cortez, other progressives land spots on powerful committee
Graham responded in a series of tweets, mocking Ocasio-Cortez's claim that the world would end in 12 years due to climate change and her idea to hike the tax rate for the nation's wealthiest.
"Let’s bury the hatchet and enjoy the next 12 years because they are going to be our last, right?" Graham responded, adding in another post that Ocasio-Cortez and her "new socialist colleagues seem hell-bent on making sure that our last 12 years will be spent as Venezuelan socialists, not Americans. "
Graham then questioned whether voters in 2020 would reject Ocasio-Cortez and her "socialist agenda. "
Ocasio-Cortez didn't reply to Graham's series of tweets.
Last week, Ocasio-Cortez, who has racked up 2. 6 million followers on Twitter, helped teach her Democratic colleagues about best practices on the forum.
She has garnered headlines for dancing outside her office, her Instant Pot recipes and the fights she has gotten into on Twitter.
Ocasio-Cortez has made a splash in the nation's capital ever since she successfully unseated Rep. Joe Crowley, the Democratic caucus chairman, in a primary. On her first day in Washington she joined climate change activists for a sit-in at Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi's office.

Citron Claims Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is Just What Twitter Needs

Full text: Last month, Citron Research pulled the plug on Twitter Inc (NASDAQ: TWTR) assuming fallout from a negative Amnesty International report. The human rights organization had criticized Twitter for facilitating abuse of women and minorities, prompting Citron to label the site the "Harvey Weinstein of social media."
But a minority woman on Twitter has reshaped the short-seller's position.
"A lot has changed in a month," Citron's Andrew Left wrote in a new report. "As if an angel was looking over Jack Dorsey's shoulder - enter Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also referred to by as 'AOC.' The 'anti-Trump' has adopted Twitter has her medium of choice and will bring a new generation of users with open minds on the platform."
'A-OK Because Of AOC'
The fiery Democratic congresswoman has attracted a new audience to the virtual public square.
Google searches for her Twitter handle have spiked since December, and she's generated twice as many interactions as Sen. Kamala Harris, nearly five times as many as CNN, and six times as many as Speaker Nancy Pelosi or Sen. Chuck Schumer. In fact, Citron said, she's racked up more than the six most prominent news organizations combined.
Axios suggested Ocasio-Cortez has more Twitter power than anyone but President Donald Trump, and her House floor remarks earned C-SPAN its most-ever views.
"The AOC Twitter phenomenon is stronger than any report from Amnesty International or any survey that shows millennials have lost interest in Twitter," Left wrote.
Stabilizing User Growth
Citron suggested her fame would be enough to stabilize Twitter's monthly-active-user metric and reinvigorate the site.
"More importantly, it will keep Twitter the idea leader for the next presidential election," Left wrote. "The rise of Ms. Cortez on Twitter is exactly what the platform needed."
Twitter shares traded at $32.13 at time of publication.

Full text: JESSE WATTERS, HOST, WATTERS' WORLD: Welcome to "Watters' World. I'm Jessie Watters. The facts about Nathan Phillips. That's the subject of tonight's "Watters' Words."
By now everybody's heard the story of the Covington boys and by the way, in a minute, we're going to have an exclusive sit down with one of the members of the community that started the whole thing, the Black Hebrew Israelites, but the media has turned a blind eye to the Native American activist. His hatred his lies and his background are going to be examined right now.
Phillips first told the "Washington Post" and other outlets that he was surrounded and harassed by the Covington boys. He told the "Detroit Free Press," the boys were quote, "attacking these four black individuals."
He continued quote, "These young men were beastly and these old black individuals was their prey." Phillips called it racism and the quote "hatred in their faces" resembled quote, "lynchings that were done in America."
He added that the students were chanting "Build the wall," and once the complete video was released, everything Phillips said turned out to be a lie. It was Phillips who approached the boys and banged his drum in their face. Nobody was about to attack the black activist and nobody was chanting "Build the wall." Phillips was never trying to diffuse the situation as he claimed.
It actually looks like Phillips and his crew were the aggressors with the students.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
NATHAN PHILLIPS, ACTIVIST: White people go back to Europe where you came from. This is not your land. No it's not. You have been here two or three generations compared to us who have been here millions of [bleep] years. So get the [bleep] out of my face with that [bleep].
Your being white, your being white. You're being a white man about it because that's all you need to to, all you got to.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: After the confrontation with the boys, what did Phillips do? He attempted to disrupt mass at Washington D.C.'s national shrine. Phillips and about 20 demonstrators tried to force themselves into evening mass, bang their drums and totally disrupt the service.
Security called the situation quote, "tense" and had to blockade Phillips and his crew from disturbing the congregation.
Phillips has a history of racially charged confrontations. Four years ago, the Native American told a very similar story claiming that white students in Michigan disrespected him and threw a beer can at him. Phillips went to the police, but no evidence turned up to support his claim.
Phillips has a rap sheet which includes assault charges, alcohol related charges and negligent driving charges. He even escaped from jail in Nebraska. There's been a lot of confusion over Nathan Philip's military service in the Vietnam era.
Now, I respect his service, but his dishonesty created that confusion. Phillips claimed he served in Vietnam and was the victim of ugly protests upon returning.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PHILLIPS: I'm a Vietnam vet and I served in the Marine Corps '72 to '76. I got honorably discharged and one of the boxes in there - it shows if it was peace time or what my box is, is that I was in theater. I don't talk much about my Vietnam times.
When I come home, those times, I got spit on, actually spit on and called a baby killer.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Now here are the facts. The Marine say Phillips was a reservist from 1972 to 1976, worked on refrigerators States side, never deployed and never served in Vietnam.
Now, there are other reports that say Phillips went AWOL several times that we haven't been able to confirm those. NBC News asked him to clarify his service record.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
PHILLIPS: What I've always said is I've never stepped foot in South Vietnam, and that's - I don't know how clear - how much clearer can that be?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: It could have been a lot clear there, Nathan. There's a phrase for that too. It's called Stolen Valor. Nathan Phillips is a lying provocateur with the victimization fetish, yet, he was the source for all of these mainstream media outlets who bought his narrative without asking any questions and used it to smear innocent high school students.
And imagine all the other shady sources the media has used to attack innocent conservatives with fake news.
Turning now to the group that instigated the Covington incident - the Black Hebrew Israelites. Here they are in Washington, D.C. yelling at the high school students.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's "Make America Great Again." A bunch of child molesting [bleep].
Look at all of these dusty [bleep] crackers with that racist garbage on.
That's right.
A bunch of incent babies.
The biggest terrorist on the face of this Earth is the pale face man, woman and child.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: The Black Hebrew Israelites are described as a Black Nationalist hate group with militant overtones. They believe blacks are the true descendants of the Biblical Israelites and many of their sects or anti-white. Many here on the East Coast, pretty familiar with the group who dress up in robes and preach their teachings on street corners.
I happened to catch up with them in Philly about two years ago.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: President Trump, how are you feeling about it?
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do I feel about President Trump? I think the white people put him off, put Trump in office and that was the man that they want to do - to rule over their people, but I think black people, Hispanics and Native Americans have a king that they need to obey and this is what my powers said, read - that's five and twenty nine.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Chapter 5 and 29, "Then Peter and all the apostles then he said, we are to obey God rather than men."
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Joining me now, Kathriel Ben Yisraeil, a former teacher at Kol Sharif B'nai Nas Israel. I don't think I got the pronunciation exactly correct, but I did my best.
Now, you heard the sound coming from people in your organization yelling at these high school students. Do you think that was appropriate?
KATHRIEL BEN YISRAEL, HEBREW ISRAELITE: Well, first of all, that organization that you speak of, is not representative of the whole nation of Israel. We're descendants by sea, by heritage of these people called Israel.
WATTERS: So you condemn these people that were hurling that kind of hateful language at the students?
BEN YISRAEL: Well, I don't know if was quite hateful --
WATTERS: It wasn't quite hateful. Crackers, incest babies, child molesters. What do you consider that? Love?
BEN YISRAEL: Well, they have a way in style that they bring their message to the people.
WATTERS: That's - what's that message though? That's a hateful message.
BEN YISRAEL: That's their style.
WATTERS: That's their style and it's pretty hateful. Come on, you're a smart man.
BEN YISRAEL: I'm not hateful. I'm an Israelite, but I am not hateful.
WATTERS: Okay, well that was pretty hateful. I think you would agree that was hateful language.
BEN YISRAEL: There's a lot of hate in America that's not really initiated by - which you want to say is like Israelite groups like that.
WATTERS: But you wouldn't agree with me that that was hateful language directed at the Covington boys by this Black Israelite group?
BEN YISRAEL: I don't know what initiated that. What the confrontation bring forth --
WATTERS: Okay, listen, I haven't seen all of the video, I have just seen what was said to the Covington boys. We didn't see anything coming from the other side directed at the Black Israelites.
BEN YISRAEL: Right. So it is basically slanted. We don't know why they responded in a way they did. You're just giving me one side of the story, so --
WATTERS: Okay, is it okay to disparage other ethnicities in the Black Israelite group?
BEN YISRAEL: Well, you keep calling it a group. Every nation has --
WATTERS: Religion.
BEN YISRAEL: It's not a religion. This is nationality.
WATTERS: Okay.
BEN YISRAEL: It's ethnicity.
WATTERS: Is your nationality okay with disparaging other racial groups?BEN YISRAEL: No, not at all.
WATTERS: Okay, that's good. I'm glad - I'm glad you said that.
BEN YISRAEL: Yes.
WATTERS: Is there a problem right now with the black Israelites? Are they angry at something specific? What's the beef?
BEN YISRAEL: Well from our perspective, we've been in captivity for 400 years. We've been denied our heritage, our land, what rightfully belongs to us as a people. We have been here for 400 years. We've had a miseducation in regards to what belongs to us naturally or ethnically as services to this country.
WATTERS: So what belongs to you specifically?
BEN YISRAEL: Specifically what belongs to us is the land.
WATTERS: In America?
BEN YISRAEL: No.
WATTERS: In Israel?
BEN YISRAEL: Absolutely.
WATTERS: Okay, so you here in America and you want the land in Israel to be given back to you?
BEN YISRAEL: Absolutely.
WATTERS: Because you believe it's rightfully yours.
BEN YISRAEL: Absolutely.
WATTERS: Okay, so you probably have to fight with the Palestinians over that.
BEN YISRAEL: Well, it's a fight --
WATTERS: Because they think it's there's, too.
BEN YISRAEL: So a lot of people think it's theirs, but prophecy says the children of Israel will return to their land from the scattered places that we've been scattered.
WATTERS: Okay, your group has been called a hate group.
BEN YISRAEL: Well, you keep saying "my group." The children of Israel came over here in slave ships and we're in churches, we are in mosques, we're in various religious doctrines that have been perpetrated on us as a captive slave body of people, and this process of awakening to know who we are, our roots are has taken on many factions and basically, they've been formulating some religious concepts where ethnically, nationally, we are descendants by sea, by heritage, by birth.
WATTERS: Okay.
BEN YISRAEL: Of the Nation of Israel.
WATTERS: All right, so in general, not talking about Covington right now, but in general, do you have a problem with white Americans wearing "Make America Great Again" hats?
BEN YISRAEL: Not at all.
WATTERS: Not at all.
BEN YISRAEL: Well that incident highlighted what the problem is with America today, because you have Native Americans who are speaking out in regards to what would transpire with them and what transpired with them, they were pushed on reservations, they lost their lands, then you have the Israelite group who we were - we're here by slavery forced against our will and given doctrines that don't even belong to us and we've lost everything and then you have the Christian school that was there and they have a right to speak as well.
WATTERS: Okay, I do think some of your members are giving you guys a bad name. Let's just watch some just recordings of some of the language that you guys have been using. Roll the tape.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. I don't want to go into slavery for a slave of the so called black, Hispanics and Native Americans. That's what the Bible say, all right, so you have to sit up here and listen. You all could take it as a joke, but guess what, all the atrocities that was done to our people, it's going to be done to you times to you.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wait. That is so uncalled --
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: [Bleep]. Get out of here.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: All right, so that's pretty aggressive rhetorically and physically. We saw the woman on the ground there. This is representative of that nationality. Anytime anybody hears about the Black Israelites, that's what they think of.
Now, I know you're saying that, you know, they don't speak for everybody, but they actually do because that's all everybody sees.
BEN YISRAEL: Well, you could say that about the Klu Klux Klan and neo Nazis and skinheads as well, does that represent you?
WATTERS: Do you believe it does?
BEN YISRAEL: Well, not really. Just like you shouldn't believe what they're saying represents all Israelites.
WATTERS: So you would compare that sect that has been, you know, pretty aggressive with the language and physically, you would compare them to the Klan.
BEN YISRAEL: No, not at all.
WATTERS: No.
BEN YISRAEL: Not at all.
WATTERS: So you don't believe that Black Israelites are superior to any other group? You think everybody is equal?
BEN YISRAEL: Absolutely.
WATTERS: Okay.
BEN YISRAEL: We're all nations on the Earth.
WATTERS: Okay.
BEN YISRAEL: We made our mistakes and we paid for it and every other nation is going to do the same thing if you become immoral and corrupt and decay, there is a price to pay.
WATTERS: Lastly, what do you think about this - Nathan Phillips, this Indian activist who was banging the drum?
BEN YISRAEL: I think he has a right to speak his mind and stand up for his people, his land, his language, this culture has been taken away violently and they have every right like everybody else that's here to speak their minds.
WATTERS: Okay, I mean, do you think that the, you know the son should pay for the sins of the father?
BEN YISRAEL: Ah yes.
WATTERS: Okay. So if my father you know, shot someone, I should pay the price?
BEN YISRAEL: If he's still in a crime family, yes.
WATTERS: Okay. What about someone's great, great, great, great, great grandfather who shot an Indian and who shot at him with a bow and arrow, do you think they should pay the price? The great, great, great, great, great, great grandson?
BEN YISRAEL: If that people is being denied what rightfully belongs to them, then something has to be done.
WATTERS: All right. Well, we disagree on that. Thank you very much. I appreciate you coming in.
BEN YISRAEL: No problem.
WATTERS: All right. All right here with more, Robert Barnes, an attorney representing several students and families from Covington Christian High School. All right, Mr. Barnes, there has been some really, really horrible things said about these boys from Covington. Have you issued any warning to these people that have been trafficking and a lot of this slanderous activity on the internet?
ROBERT BARNES, ATTORNEY FOR COVINGTON FAMILIES: Yes, to a wide range of people. So Maggie Haberman was one of the first people who was calling for the kids' expulsion.
WATTERS: The "New York Times" reporter.
BARNES: Yes, the lead "New York Times" reporter making false statements about these kids, calling for punitive action against these kids whom she's never met, who are private citizens based on an event she didn't even witness.
It should - it really tells you something about the standard of the "New York Times" that something like that could happen, but also others. Congresswoman Omar made false statements about these kids. We requested that she retract it or we would sue her. Well, an n hour later, she did retract it to her credit, but others have not retracted.
So some have -- Kathy Griffin has.
WATTERS: Oh, you got Kathy Griffin to retract.
BARNES: Jake Tapper has, Meghan McCain has.
WATTERS: That's a big retraction. She oftentimes does not retract. I see someone - Reza Aslan, this guy has appeared on "The Daily Show" on CNN a lot. Here's what he said. He said, "Honest question, have you ever seen a more punishable face than these kids?" He has not retracted that.
BARNES: That's correct. And he's going to get sued next week.
WATTERS: Wow.
BARNES: Similarly Matthew Dowd, there's been a request that he retract, he's an ABC commentator, pretends to be a Republican commentator. He's made false statements about these kids, refuse to retract it and he did it interspersing it with statements about how we should love each other consistent with the Christian tradition. If he doesn't retract, he's going to get sued.
Michael Rapaport did a crude rap - sort of image against these kids. He has refused to retract. He's a famous Hollywood actor that's on a Netflix show about how we should avoid childhood bullying of kids and here, he is bullying kids.
WATTERS: That's ironic.
BARNES: So several of the "New York Daily News" put a false headline out that various kids from the school had appeared in blackface, totally false. They've been in a blackout, which is very common throughout the country in high school basketball games.
WATTERS: Are you going to go after the "New York Daily News" for that?
BARNES: They are going to get sued.
WATTERS: Oh, they're going to get sued.
BARNES: Yes, the "New York Daily News" will be sued.
WATTERS: So everyone is getting sued, it seems like. Now from my limited understanding of the law, I did not going to law school. It's a very high bar, the slander and the libel. I mean, you have to show malicious intent and knowingly that something is wrong and defamatory and it doesn't always work in court. Are you confident that you're going to be able to secure judgments?
BARNES: Yes, because in this case, there's a unique exception. So when there's a defamation and libel of private citizens, particularly minors, then the legal standard goes way down, so you no longer have to prove actual malice or malevolent intent. All you have to prove is that a false statement was made or in Kentucky, the law is even broader, an unflattering impression given and put a person's reputation in a false light and otherwise, and just let it be negligent for them to do so. That's why the whole family gave everybody 48 hours to correct all of these statements.
If they still refuse to do so, it's clearly negligent for them to keep false statements and they will be subject to --
WATTERS: Oh, you know what strikes me is amazing. Remember the Parkland shooter situation where everybody was going after the students and people immediately said, "You cannot go after students. You cannot say anything about students. They're minors."
Yet, you had the entire mainstream media establishment and celebrities descend on these high school students, smearing them, calling them racist, digging into their backgrounds, digging into the school and no one said anything. Huge double standard. It seems like all minors should be off limits.
You've spoken to these kids. I know you're in regular discussion. What are their spirits like? Because I know going forward, I mean, they could have potential problems with college admissions with their resumes. You know, their online profiles are permanently damaged as a result of this. How are they doing?
BARNES: It's been brutal. They've described it as complete hell. They've described it as one of the most difficult weeks they've ever lived in their lives. These are kids who - they've been told they can't use social media. They're being subject to internal investigations to cover up for the failure of other people to properly identify this in the school authority system.
So they've been through one of the most difficult, you know, they went to DC to participate to one of our greatest political traditions, expressing their political viewpoint. And instead, they get ambushed by lefty agitator provocateur advocates who then lie about them. But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was some of the most institutionally powerful people in the establishment press, lied and defamed them and it could destroy their careers. It could destroy their reputations. It could destroy their futures and it's made their current life a living hell.
WATTERS: Well, I'm glad there's some accountability because if there's no accountability, it's going to continue to happen. Robert, thanks very much and keep us posted on the lawsuits. I mean, if you don't even win, at least you're going to grind them to dust in legal fees. I appreciate you coming.
BARNES: Yes, the goal is to send a message that they'll remember.
WATTERS: Exactly. Robert, thank you very much.
BARNES: Thank you.
WATTERS: All right up next, an Alyssa Milano investigation. "Watters' World" has been looking into it. We'll tell you the latest. What is going on with Alyssa?
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Everybody my age at least remembers Samantha from "Who's the Boss."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TONY DANZA, AMERICAN ACTOR: Why are you going like this?
ALYSSA MILANO, AMERICAN ACTRESS: It's a new dance. Yes, everyone is doing it. Yes, and you can do it on the other side, too.
DANZA: Oh, yes, sure you do. Look. Samantha, that's a hickey.
MILANO: Whoa. How did that get there?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: We all watched Alyssa Milano grow up, as the actress moved on to the hit show, "Charmed." She was a big hit over there. But recently, she has gone hard left.
The actress made a big splash at the Kavanaugh hearing sitting right behind Judge Kavanaugh and at one point, security had to come over and talk to her. She's been militant on Twitter, attacking the President for instance, quote, "You teargassed women and children, A-wipe." And on Thanksgiving weekend, "You piece of S blank- hole mother effing evil creature person."
And this week, she drew fire after she compared the Covington kids to the Klan. Ready? "The red MAGA hat is the new white hood without white boys being able to empathize with other people. Humanity will continue to destroy itself. #FirstThoughtsWhenIWakeUp."
Here to respond, Communications Director for Turning Point USA, Candace Owens. Well, Candace, you're a little younger than I am, I hate to admit it, but I have to. I love the Samantha on "Who's the Boss." I think I might even had a crush on her. It was so long ago. I don't even remember.
But just her trajectory over the last - I don't know, three to four to five years, she has just gone so hardcore left, almost unrecognizable to the dear Samantha she used to play on television. What happened to Alyssa Milano?
CANDACE OWENS, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA: Well, first and foremost, I am too young, so I don't remember the dear Samantha that you remember.
WATTERS: Ouch, ouch.
OWENS: I only know this hard left insane person that tweets things that are ultimately, you could laugh at, but it's also really offensive. You aren't talking about cultural appropriation.
Imagine being a white woman who's had no experience with the KKK, no history of it in her family. My grandfather is still breathing, so when somebody wants to talk about the KKK, those stories growing up in my household, they're very real. They used to shoot bullets inside of his home, you know, I'm a black American.
For her, it's nothing. It's just a means for her to shout into the Twitter echo chamber and to get feedback and try to get power, which is really what the left is all about now. They use minority experiences to garner power and attention for themselves. And I called her out for that this week on Twitter and she blocked me.
WATTERS: She blocked you?
OWENS: Go figure.
WATTERS: So --
OWENS: Instantly.
WATTERS: What did you say to her? When you called her out, what did you say to her? Because what is she? Is she emotional? Is she not used to criticism?
OWENS: Well, what I said is - I was being funny, and I said that the [bleep] hat is the new KKK hood. And then I said, "Pause. Just kidding. I wanted to try being as incomprehensibly stupid as Alyssa Milano," and it got 20,000 retweets and she blocked me, but this is funny because this is a woman who says that she champions minority voices and yet, when a minority voice steps up and says they disagree with her, she instantly blocks it.
What does that mean? Everything she does is self-serving. She doesn't care about minorities. She doesn't care about minority voices. She cares about power and attention for herself, like most leftists do.
WATTERS: Well, I don't even know if you're allowed to say the "P" word, maybe you can since you're a woman, but we'll have to --
OWENS: That's what they call them.
WATTERS: We'll have to find out. I guess, you're right. Okay. She's you know, she's got all these donations, she's giving to all Democrats -- Bernie Obama, Andrew Gillum -- I mean, who knows. It looks like she's going to have to be deleting a lot more tweets soon because after that guy gets a hold of her that we just heard suing everybody over the Covington story, she better be careful unless she wants to face a lawsuit.
Another person you tangle with all the time on Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, here she is talking about the world ending. Watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
ALEXANDRA OCASIO-CORTEZ, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, NEW YORK, DEMOCRAT: Millennials and people you know, Gen Z and all of these folks that come after us are looking up and we're like, "The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change." And your biggest issue is - your biggest issue is how are we going to pay for it? And like this is the war. This is our World War II.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Wow. So it's over in 12 years, so I might as well just go on vacation, Candace.
OWENS: I don't know what I'm doing here. I've got 12 years left and I'm sitting here on "Watters's World." I need to go live my best life. What am I doing here right now?
WATTERS: I think you're living your best life.
OWENS: Look, AOC --
WATTERS: That's my opinion. Go ahead.
OWENS: All right, this is what actually what I want to do the rest of my life is talk to Jesse Watters, but - so listen, AOC, I actually in a weird way, I like her because she does serve the GOP. She does serve Republican side and she does serve conservatives because she's effectively splintering of a Democratic Party.
I always say there's two wings of the Democrat Party; one is people that are completely ignorant like her. They don't know mathematics. They don't know economics. They don't know World History. They don't know world present, forget history. She doesn't even know what's going on in Venezuela today.
But then the other side, it's just like the sheer evil people like Nancy Pelosi and the Chuck Schumer's who knows exactly what they're doing and they know that they're lying to people.
WATTERS: You forgot one last one.
OWENS: So I think she helps us.
WATTERS: You forgot the chicken wing. That's a very critical wing in the Democratic Party. Candace, I've got to run. I've got to run. I'm getting old, you know, and the world's about to end, so I've got to see you later. Thank you very much.
OWENS: Bye, Jesse.
WATTERS: All right. Up next, new footage of illegals crossing the border still not enough to convince Democrats. The shutdown is over and later, an emotional support alligator swims into "Watters' World."
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BRYAN LLENAS, NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: Live from "America's News Headquarters," I'm Bryan Llenas. Tragedy in Brazil after a dam collapsed Friday leaves at least 40 people dead. At least 300 people remain missing and authorities fear the death toll will go higher. Rescue workers have been searching by air and digging through several feet of mud for survivors. Mine employees were having lunch Friday afternoon when the dam gave way unleashing a sea of reddish brown mud. It's unknown what caused the collapse.
The US military is investigating why two Russian bombers found their way into North American airspace earlier today. American and Canadian forces were able to scramble and intercept the pair, NORAD says the Russian bombers quote "remained in international airspace." The incident comes as the NATO Secretary General meets with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington. I'm Bryan Llenas, now back to "Watters' World."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the Federal government.
We really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. If we don't get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15th again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: President Trump announcing Friday a temporary reopening of the Federal government after five weeks of a shutdown. The deal postpones negotiations of his $5.7 billion request for wall funding.
Meanwhile, agents in Arizona apprehended 110 illegals scaling a border fence with a ladder - fences are very good. Here to react, Liberal commentator, Cathy Areu and former intelligence analyst and commentator, Morgan Ortagus.
Okay, Morgan I know the President just delayed this whole thing for a few more weeks. He says he is going to declare a national emergency if he doesn't get the border wall funding he wants. What have we been doing for the last five weeks? It just seems like both sides hurt the American people. They got hurt by not having border wall funding and then they got hurt by not getting paid.
MORGAN ORTAGUS, FORMER INTELLIGENCE ANALYST AND COMMENTATOR: Well, I think that's a fair assessment, but I think what we're looking at now is a three-week continuing resolution and in that continuing resolution, the President is giving the Congress yet another opportunity to get to a deal before he potentially declares a national emergency.
He hasn't said he's going to do that. In fact, a lot of news media came out ahead of time, preempted him saying that that's what he was going to declare, but he's clearly trying to avoid that because I think he knows the legal ramifications, how long it would be in court if he had to go through that.
So I think it's a smart move to continue the negotiations. I mean, at this point, the Democrats are holding everything hostage --
WATTERS: They are.
ORTAGUS: They are willing to see people without paychecks. They voted three times to not have them get paid.
WATTERS: I know, and if you look at the polls everybody says, "Oh the President is getting so hurt by this." I have a poll I want you to look at Cathy, it's a CBS poll, not fake news, right? It says "What do you want Democrats in Congress to do now?" Refuse to fund the wall 43%; pass the budget with wall funding.
So the people wanted the Democrats to fund the wall and reopen the government. It's just everyone is so confused on this issue. Did you think the President looks weak by delaying this three weeks, Cathy?
CATHY AREU, LIBERAL COMMENTATOR: I don't think he looked weak. It just seemed to me that he was making up statistics. Crime, he says is low - lower than ever, but then he says, "We need that wall to make sure that crime remains low." To me, it sounds like he's just confused and it's making the whole world look like we have a dysfunctional government. It's just embarrassing really that the government shut down in the first place.
WATTERS: Well, listen, Cathy, I mean, you know - you've heard stories, I mean, you watch Fox, you're on Fox, you know the stories of illegal immigrants committing crimes here. I mean, that's just a fact. Can I just show you some tape --
AREU: Undocumented --
WATTERS: I'm going to show you some tape.
AREU: Undocumented people.
WATTERS: Yes, undocumented people. Visitors as you would like to call them. I'm going to show you --
AREU: Thanks.
WATTERS: I am going to show you some tape, look at these illegal immigrants or visitors throwing rocks at Border Patrol agents. They have, you know, this river, right, it's a very shallow river. There's just not a lot of room in between there and they have - they have these illegal immigrants hurling rocks at the Border Patrol boat. Why? Why do you guys continue to look at the evidence of the crime and the danger and not change your mind?
AREU: I mean, but you're not saying that undocumented people in this country pay over $11 billion in taxes that more crimes are committed by Native Americans than undocumented people? So for many ...
WATTERS: Native Americans, like American Indians?
AREU: ... rocks that are thrown - no, American, non- immigrants, so the non-immigrants, the people that are here that are documented commit more crimes than undocumented people, but would love to be citizens.
WATTERS: Okay, well, I mean, just because men commit more crimes than women doesn't mean you don't try to prevent women from committing crimes. I don't understand the analogy. What do you think about all the damage that is being done on the southern border to the women, Morgan? I mean, there's rapes going on, there's human trafficking, smuggling, children are being hurt.
ORTAGUS: Right, so I actually have a new piece out in the "Washington Examiner" that your audience can read on this.
WATTERS: Oh, beautiful plug.
ORTAGUS: Thank you, and what I talked about is what we've done for the past 35 years as it relates to the northern triangle countries. This is Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and how - what measures we could take to sort of prevent this from happening.
We've had a lot of failed policies for 35 years and people right now, the public relations aspect of this is people think that they can come here and then it's going to be the safe journey and they're going to get in it.
WATTERS: Right, it's not a safe journey.
ORTAGUS: It's a moral imperative for us --
WATTERS: Peaceful visitors. Guys, I've got to run. Thank you very much. Still ahead, a man and his emotional support alligator makes a splash into "Watters' World." But next, Diamond and Silk.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
WATTERS: Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries spoke at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event and took the opportunity to compare our President to the KKK.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
HAKEEM JEFFRIES, U.S. CONGRESSMAN, NEW YORK, DEMOCRAT: We have a hater in the White House. The Birther-in-Chief of the Grand Wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Diamond and Silk join me now. I'm sure Martin Luther King would have loved that comparison. Right, ladies?
DIAMOND, VIDEOBLOGGER: No, no. And he said, I heard that he was trying to walk back those comments, but he don't need to walk back anything. He needs to take responsibility for his slandering remarks.
SILK, VIDEOBLOGGER: That's right.
DIAMOND: Disparity remarks against the President and the White House. And then what he needs to do is pause and stop acting like he has a selective memory and go back to the time when he was really pushing Hillary Clinton for President, but Hillary Clinton had ties and she said a mentor, a man that was tied to the KKK, even though he was an ex-member, she was tied to him and she said that was her mentor and that she loved him.
SILK: That's right. And when I'm looking at Hakeem Jeffries, we do have a hater in Congress house. That's where he's at. And he is a race baiting hater.
WATTERS: Wow. All right, ladies unleashed. You get Robert Byrd, West Virginia, no one seems to remember him. Okay, Michael Moore was popping off at the mouth talking about building a wall somewhere. Let's hear what he had to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MICHAEL MOORE, AMERICAN FILM MAKER: So if he tries to pull a national emergency, we, the people have to declare a national emergency. We have to non-violently rise up. We have to take to the streets. We have to form - we have to build our own wall, a human wall around the White House, around the White House and peacefully ...
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: So it looks like Moore is admitting walls work.
DIAMOND; Well, walls do work, but not human walls. We need a steel barrier and he needs to be at the border. You know, shame on people like Michael Moore and these - what I call these elite liberals, left leaning liberals who don't realize that illegal aliens crossing our borders, killing our citizens, driving down wages cannot be tolerated in this country. It's time to secure our borders. Walls work. Borders work. If walls didn't work, you wouldn't have walls in your homes.
SILK: That's right.
WATTERS: All right, I'm not going to make a wall joke about Michael Moore. I don't want to fat shame him - that would just be beneath me. So I'm going to zip my lip. Lastly, I want to get to Jake Talbot, who's a veteran, he said he was booted out of the gym for a Trump t-shirt. Listen to this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAKE TALBOT, ARMY VETERAN: I just love CDY Fitness here in Troy working out and when I was starting, the owner - well, she came up to me and said that my Trump shirt that I had on was offensive and that I needed to remove it in order to work out there. And it's linked to racism which I freaking hate that word whenever people use it. It's spun on way too loosely, it's 2019, get the hell over it. It's not racism.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
WATTERS: Wow.
DIAMOND: Wow.
SILK: Wow.
DIAMOND: You know, Jesse, okay, but you know what? Okay, well, I find it equally offensive when I see these women walking in the streets with those whoozi on because to me that promotes vulgarity, I mean, it really does, okay? But I don't say anything about that.
Here's the deal, if you don't like the t-shirt that somebody is wearing, then don't you buy it. But don't infringe on anyone's right to wear whatever they want to wear.
SILK: And why are the Democrats running around here acting like dictators? They are acting worse than Hitler? They are Hitler because they are acting like them. Look at it. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your free speech. They want to tell you what you can and cannot say, who you can and cannot see. They need to stop acting like dictators over here in America.
WATTERS: All right, well, the Hitler comparison might be going a little too far. But you know what? That's why I haven't been working out at the gym. You know, I've been - I was wearing a Trump shirt. That's why I haven't really been hitting the weights. That's my excuse at least. All right, ladies, have a nice weekend.
DIAMOND: Thank you for having us.
SILK: Thank you for having us.
WATTERS: Up next, an emotional support alligator wades into "Watters' World."

WATTERS: That was me on a gator hunt down in Florida a few years ago. But our next guest isn't scared at all. Joey Henney in his emotional support alligator Wally join me now. All right, Joey. A lot of people are looking at this situation and saying what a crock.
JOEY HENNEY, ALLIGATOR OWNER: Well, it's not a crock. It's for real.
WATTERS: Okay. Why do you need an alligator for emotional support? Why not a puppy?
HENNEY: Well, I'm not much of a dog or a cat person. When I was little, I raised bulls when I was a kid and became a bull rider. Ah, I like wild animals. But Wally wasn't gotten just for an emotional support animal. We rescue alligators.
WATTERS: Okay, so he serves many purposes. What does Wally provide emotional support for? Do you have an addiction? Do you have a disorder that you get a doctor's note for this?
HENNEY: Yes, I did have a doctor's note and he helped me through my time of depression when I lost three lifelong friends within a week and two with less than 24 hours apart and I went through a lot of depression.
WATTERS: Okay, so Wally has been there for you in times of need. Do you take Wally to the grocery store or to the bar? Are not allowed to do that?
HENNEY: Wally is my emotional support alligator from my home use and stuff, but we are invited everywhere. I do take him to Lowe's and Home Depot and he is usually always welcome there. What up buddy? Wally.
WATTERS: Okay, I see you kind of --
HENNEY: He's an alligator for fawning.
WATTERS: I see you kind of snuggling up with Wally. Do you like get a blanket and watch Netflix together?
HENNEY: No, but we do watch TV together. He'll get up and watch TV or lay there with me and just snuggle up and watch TV or just lying there and do nothing.
WATTERS: Do you bring Wally out on dates?
HENNEY: No.
WATTERS: I think he might want to. I think that could be a great conversation piece. But what do I know?
HENNEY: Yes, I guess, it could be?
WATTERS: Is Wally dangerous? I mean, can you snap at anybody when you guys are in Home Depot?
HENNEY: He's never tried. He's never attempted. We've had in 14 months from when he was rescued from the wild and he has never tried to bite anyone.
WATTERS: Okay.
HENNEY: You see, his mouth is not taped now.
WATTERS: Okay, well, you know what, if I ever visit, which I might, please tape the mouth.
HENNEY: Yes, when we take him out to visit, we usually put a rubber band or tape in his mouth, yes.
WATTERS: All right, well, Joey and Wally, welcome to my world. I never thought I'd see an emotional support reptile, but what do you know? Good luck and have fun at Home Depot. Be safe.
HENNEY: Yes. Thank you.

How to Recognize the Fascistic Turn

Full text: In an interview on the venerable CBS news program 60 Minutes two weeks ago, freshman Representative (and Twitter sensation) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was asked a wide range of questions about her personal views, her political priorities, and other topics. Inevitably, the issue of her recent spate of misstatements — some of which appear to be flubs, others undoubtedly attempting to mislead — arose, to which she responded: “I think there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually and semantically correct than about being morally right.”
Unsurprisingly, Ocasio-Cortez’s comment was viewed positively by her supporters (an affirmation of her good intentions, if perhaps revealing her still-novice state in Washington) but derided by her detractors as an excuse for a combination of mendacity and clumsiness — a franchise that previously seemed the exclusive domain of the current president. For the most part, partisan views governed both the reception of and response to her comment, which was within a few days forgotten, a new range of issues — the partial government shutdown, taxing billionaires, and so on — taking the forefront.
Ocasio-Cortez and the incoming class of congressmen want to be taken seriously, and in particular, they want their ideas to be taken seriously. It is for this reason that a comment that explicitly elevates sentiment and action over fact and reason must be taken with the utmost seriousness, especially when voiced by a proponent of radical economic and social overhaul. The idea that “rightness” and emotional fervor trump substance has a distinct and deeply troubling past that deserves much closer examination.
The first task of any radical movement is to discredit established knowledge — academic, experimental, experiential — as either utterly incorrect, partially true, or most commonly a tool of control. Hard-won, often-difficult truths are decried as provisional. Reason itself is dismissed as insufficient and erroneous.
In common, Nietzsche and Heidegger expounded the notion that because the pillars of Western accomplishment — the social, economic, and political blooming of the Enlightenment — were essentially dead weight, action and will are superior to truth. The deconstructionist and postmodern philosophers have continued the philosophy that truth is, in Nietzsche’s words, “a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms.”
Common among the Italian Fascisti, the Russian Bolsheviks, the German Brownshirts and later National Socialists, the Sixties radicals, every Third World “agrarian reformer,” the failed Occupy Wall Street movement, and this new wave of bright-eyed collectivists, as evinced by Ocasio-Cortez’s comment, is the tenet that passion and spirit are more important than truth. Hitler spoke of the “cult of the deed”; Mussolini endlessly touted the idea that “to live is not to calculate, but to act!” Sixties ‘revolutionaries’ shouted, “Tactics? It’s too late — let’s break what we can.”
Meaning — “rightness” — is thus created by power, a power not exerted by superior command of facts and the accumulation of experience, but by action. Proponents of all of these views are animated by a philosophy that says, in essence: “We may be wrong, but we believe we are pure.” Power, not truth, is the overriding concern.
(It bears mentioning that this posture ties to the irrepressible instinct of radical movements to assail individuals as impotent, instead lobbying for mass action, whether in the form of “community organizers,” Sturmabteilung squads, units of Blackshirts, cells of Weathermen, or the timeless focus of political activists for time immemorial: “the People”.)
The “lot of people” who are, as Ocasio-Cortez put it, more concerned with factual correctness than moral rightness are those who politicians should and do fear; they temper and defang political zealotry. There is more than enough proof, historically, that regardless of political orientation, individuals sufficiently compelled by idealism to promote the discard of reason have only one direction in which to go, whether they intend to or not: destruction.
In explicitly promoting conviction and righteousness at the expense of factualness and actuality, Ocasio-Cortez and her ilk are — in pursuit of socialistic ends — doing so beneath the philosophical mantle of fascism.

El muro de Trump era Nancy Pelosi

Full text: El cierre del Gobierno estadounidense supuso una derrota para el mandatario. La presidenta de la Cámara baja, demócrata, ganó gracias a su sangre fría
"Mi estilo de negociar es bastante simple y directo. Apunto muy alto y entonces empujo y empujo hasta conseguir lo que busco". Así es cómo Donald Trump definía en los años ochenta su estrategia negociadora en el salvaje mercado inmobiliario de Manhattan. Y ese es el estilo que ha marcado también su presidencia. Su pulso por arrancar una partida presupuestaria para empezar a construir el polémico muro en la frontera de México -arguyendo la lucha contra la inmigración irregular- llevó al cierre de la Administración estadounidense el pasado diciembre por falta de fondos.
Si los legisladores demócratas no pasaban por el aro de ese muro, no habría acuerdo de financiación y cerraría el Gobierno. Amenazó con mantenerlo así hasta el infinito. Pero el viernes pasado, tras 35 días, claudicó y reabrió la Administración sin rastro de esos dólares. Se había estampado con otro muro bien distinto y que no esperaba: Nancy Pelosi.
La presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, tercera autoridad de la nación, lleva más de 30 años en la jungla de Washington y ha mamado la lucha política desde que nació. Su padre, Thomas D'Alesandro, fue congresista, alcalde de Baltimore y frustrado aspirante a gobernador. Ella se lanzó como legisladora demócrata desde California, adonde se mudó tras casarse con el financiero Paul Pelosi. Rica, blanca y católica, simboliza para muchos la quintaesencia del establishment .
Su hoja de servicios, no obstante, la acredita como una de las voces más liberales del partido: votó contra la guerra de Irak y fue una de las primeras en apoyar el matrimonio gay, cuando casi ningún progresista, incluido Barack Obama, lo hacía aún. En 2007 se convirtió en la primera mujer speaker del Congreso y en 2019 ha regresado al puesto conteniendo el conato de revuelta entre los demócratas que reclamaban otro rostro. Tiene 78 años, ama el poder y ha doblado el brazo de Trump con sangre fría.
"Es un berrinche del presidente. Tengo cinco hijos, nueve nietos, y reconozco un berrinche cuando lo veo". Así es como Pelosi se refería el 11 de enero al mandatario, después de una de esas negociaciones infructuosas y una tormenta de mensajes en la cuenta del republicano. Justo un mes antes, durante una acalorada discusión ante las cámaras con la californiana y Chuck Schumer, líder demócrata en el Senado, su temperamento le traicionó: "Me siento orgulloso de cerrar el Gobierno por seguridad en la frontera porque la gente de este país no quiere delincuentes, hay drogas y gente con muchos problemas entrando en nuestro país", espetó a mediados de diciembre. Muchos ciudadanos lo recordarían después.
Trump lanzó una carrera kamikaze. En Estados Unidos lo llaman chicken game (una expresión que se podría traducir por "juego del gallina"): dos personas conducen sendos vehículos en dirección contraria y quien primer tuerce por temor a la colisión, pierde. Ese es el "gallina". Pero esta vez, el otro conductor era una veterana del barro que no planea presentarse a ninguna elección presidencial y que, como él, sabe muy bien lo que es vivir con bajos índices de popularidad.
Colas en la beneficencia
El 21 de diciembre, la Administración de EE UU entró en un cierre parcial, con 800.000 empleados federales afectados. Los coches empezaron a avanzar el uno contra el otro. El presidente pisó el acelerador: "Este cierre puede durar mucho tiempo", advertía conforme pasaban los días y no había visos de acuerdo. El 11 de enero se convirtió en el más largo de la historia del país. Los empleados empezaron a dejar de cobrar sus nóminas.
Los conductores se iban acercando cada vez más, pero uno empezó a sentir más miedo: los votantes, según diferentes encuestas, culpaban principalmente a Trump (el 47%, según la de Politico / Morning Consult, por ejemplo), después a los demócratas del Congreso (33%) y en menor medida a los republicanos (5%). Había calculado mal. Acto seguido, Pelosi le hirió donde le duele. Utilizando su prerrogativa como líder de la Cámara de Representantes, le retiró la invitación a pronunciar el discurso del Estado de la Unión -uno de los grandes momentos televisivos del año de un presidente, que estaba previsto el 29 de enero en el Capitolio- por motivos de seguridad. Trump respondió negándole un viaje a Afganistán con recursos públicos.
El cierre cumplió un mes. La economía se empezó a resentir -la calificadora S&P cifró el impacto de las tres primeras semanas en 3.600 millones de dólares (unos 3.155 millones de euros)- y el ánimo del país, también, con imágenes de empleados públicos haciendo cola en la beneficencia.
El 23 de enero, Trump, que había barajado pronunciar un discurso alternativo al del Estado de la Unión en otra ubicación, anunció que debía retrasarlo. Dos días después, cedió y anunció que abría el Gobierno tres semanas para seguir negociando el muro. Ayer, Pelosi anunció que ha propuesto al mandatario el 5 de febrero como fecha para la celbración de ese discurso.
El coche de Pelosi ganó. Algunas de las voces más nuevas y rebeldes del Partido Demócrata, que habían cuestionado el retorno de la veterana legisladora como líder de la Cámara, mostraron sus respetos. "Voy a decir algo que la mayor parte del país ya sabe: la speaker Pelosi no va con tonterías", escribió en Twitter Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, la congresista más joven de Washington y estrella fulgurante del partido, en respuesta a un comentario de Pelosi sobre la trama rusa.
Mientras, a Trump se le rebeló la línea dura del trumpismo. Ann Coulter, una columnista conservadora, se pronunció sin piedad: "Buenas noticias para George Herbert Walker Bush: desde hoy, ya no es el mayor pelele que jamás haya servido como presidente de EE UU".

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fuels Twitter storm by suggesting employers shouldn't mind if men and women make their incomes public

Full text: Freshman congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez caused a Twitter storm by suggesting companies shouldn’t mind if office workers share personal financial information with one another.
“If ‘the wage gap is a myth’ as some allege, then workplaces should have no problem with workers disclosing our salaries with one another,” she tweeted to her 2.7 million followers Wednesday.
Ocasio-Cortez joined lawmakers in Washington D.C. Wednesday morning to introduce the Paycheck Fairness Act to help ensure men and women are paid the same wages for the same jobs. The event also marked the 10-year anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which allows women to seek relief in court for wage discrimination.
Women nationwide make 20% less than men, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
It’s Cortez’s contention that making payrolls public would help remedy that inequity. Not all of her followers believe that’s a good idea.
“There are so many other reasons why sharing is a terrible idea,” one man tweeted. Another user questioned the legitimacy of that claim because it came from a man.
A user who goes by @saraheunicycle weighed in, saying she works in human resources and her company’s rationale behind keeping wages a secret is that current employees would be unhappy to learn new hires are being lured to the company with higher paychecks than people already on the payroll.
“I work in HR. In our case I can say this is totally not the reason we don't want you to share salary info,” she wrote. “We 100% don't want you to know that we are paying new hires three times what we're paying our incumbents due to a stingy pay increase structure. Pretty common in corporate.”
Another man who says it’s “no one else’s business” what he earns argued that numbers don’t tell the whole story when it comes to wages.
“If a company discloses your salary to other employees, you're forced to discuss information which should remain private along with performance reviews, expectations, etc.” @DrDerekDBA wrote.
@AmazonMandy pointed out that Ocasio-Cortez was floating an idea, not imposing a mandate.
“No one's saying you have to share. However, there shouldn't be workplace bans on it if people want to discuss it,” she wrote.
Other AOC Twitter followers chimed in, saying experience, education and other variables figure into establishing workers’ wages. Others pointed out that some debates focusing on inequity don’t consider the sorts of jobs men and women are getting.
Several users suggested that if women can and will do the same jobs as men, greedy companies should exclusively hire women, pay them 20% less than they’d pay men to do that work, and watch corporate profits skyrocket.
For Ocasio-Cortez personally, income inequality isn’t a problem. Congressmen and women start at $174,000 a year. The House Speaker job, which is currently held by a woman, pays $223,500 annually.

Tomi Lahren Doesn’t Think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Is ‘Successful in Real Life’

Full text: Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt dared to refer to 29-year-old Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “successful” on Thursday morning. But 26-year-old Fox News pundit Tomi Lahren just couldn’t accept that premise.
“Don’t you think Democrats were trying to find their way, trying to find their footing,” Earhardt asked, “and then Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is very successful and she’s the darling of the Democratic Party and she is so far left and has these socialist ideas and then the Democrats are saying, ‘Oh, that worked for her, maybe that’s our ticket, bingo.’”
After Earhardt concluded by suggesting “the left keeps going further and further left,” it was Lahren’s turn to give her take.

“Well again, there’s a difference between being successful on Twitter and social media like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and being relatable on social media platforms,” Lahren said, “and actually being successful in real life.”
Lahren added that she doesn’t think any of the current 2020 Democratic nominees pose a “threat” to Trump—despite the fact that every single one leads him in recent polls—unless the president fails to build his wall. “We’re in for a real treat in 2020 if this is the crop of Democrats we have to deal with,” she said.
Like many on the right, Lahren has expressed particular and repeated ire for Ocasio-Cortez, especially after the New York lawmaker responded to the Fox News pundit’s Twitter war with rapper Cardi B earlier this month.

After Cardi B threatened to “dog walk” Lahren for mocking her “genius political mind,” Ocasio-Cortez asked: “Why do people think they can mess with Bronx women without getting roasted?”
Later that week, Lahren accused Ocasio-Cortez of encouraging “physical violence” against her, saying on Fox News, “Listen, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, on all daily basis, says that Trump supporters and President Trump himself incite violence and then she goes and applauds and encourages a tweet by a rapper who threatens physical violence against me. So, again, this is a double standard at play and it’s not just rappers, it’s not trust trolls on Twitter, these are elected representatives who are endorsing and saying the same thing.”
“Can you imagine if I would threaten to ‘dog walk’ Cardi B, or anyone else for that matter, as a conservative, as a Trump supporter?” she asked. “I would never get away with that!”

Full text: (COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.
I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, February 5th.
Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.
Earnings are in focus this morning. Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results. Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today. Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.
Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening. Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.
This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact. The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent. The S&P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent. And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq. Big tech did well.
Global markets this morning mostly higher. Take a look at the European indices. FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent. CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent. And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points. Better than 1 percent.
In Asia overnight. It is the lunar holiday. Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year. However, Japan is open. And it was down a fraction.
It is celebrating the Year of the Pig. How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year. We've got the details there coming up.
And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight. President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight. Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency. It has never been his preferred option. At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: All the details coming up.
And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings. It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate. Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion. We will take a look at the stock coming up.
Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter. Wait until you see this.
Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning. Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.
All those stories coming up this morning.
But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address. President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.
It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: What's the state of the Trump administration? The state of the Trump administration is chaos. It is sad -- the State of the Union. And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President. I hope he changes in the next two years.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman it's always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Thanks for having me.
BARTIROMO: Is it chaos? I mean walk us -- you're there. You're the minority leader. Tell us what government looks like today.
MCCARTHY: Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA. We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before. I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.
The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating. Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security. What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way? They celebrate status quo. So it does not solve the DACA problem.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCCARTHY: They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.
BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean they say that they are for border security. But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.
So is this all just resist because they hate him? They want him out?
MCCARTHY: Yes. Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.
BARTIROMO: In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.
MCCARTHY: Yes. And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona. You got to El Paso. El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America. So there's an ability to do this
But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.
And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time. And I think that's what America look for -- common ground. But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.
BARTIROMO: Well, you had conversations. How are the conversations going now? Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week? You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.
MCCARTHY: They've only met one time. And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall. Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before. But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.
BARTIROMO: What are you going to do? I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight. Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.
Is a compromise even feasible? And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years? That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?
MCCARTHY: I hope not. I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics. We can always have a campaign. We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first. And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work
Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want. But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing. But that's really not where all her members are. More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.
BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that. Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?
MCCARTHY: I think so. But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border. I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.
California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego. And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego? It's pretty obvious, right?
(CROSSTALKING)
MCCARTHY: Yes. These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there. This is what's really backwards in their thinking. You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas. And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it. I think everybody in America believes that.
The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do. Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue. And the Democrats are saying no.
BARTIROMO: So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?
MCCARTHY: I can guarantee you this. If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes. But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.
We've got so much more to do. We've got infrastructure. We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.
BARTIROMO: Is that going to be approved though? I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA. So what happens if you can't ratify that?
MCCARTHY: America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation. Why would they oppose that?
BARTIROMO: A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech. The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name. Democrats are getting political. Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.
Tell us about that. I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?
MCCARTHY: Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else. I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.
We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us. Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years. We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.
We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before. So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others. America is in a point to make the next century ours. The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.
BARTIROMO: The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right. What about the issue around trade? China, for example. A lot of people want to see a deal done.
But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?
MCCARTHY: No.
BARTIROMO: We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean. What about the IP issue? Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.
MCCARTHY: They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process. This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before. And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.
And I think this President is right. We're finding China for the first time coming to the table. But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal. This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.
BARTIROMO: Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place. You heard us on the program. Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy. Has it hurt the economy?
MCCARTHY: There's areas that it hurts. There're areas that it supports. If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going. But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term. Will we be stronger long-term? Will there be more American jobs?
Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?
BARTIROMO: Yes -- 304,000.
(CROSSTALKING)
MCCARTHY: -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time. I mean this president has put the American worker first. Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.
So we're stronger where we're going. But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCCARTHY: So this is more than buying more soybeans. This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.
BARTIROMO: Yes. And I asked the question earlier. If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.
MCCARTHY: They have a closed society. They still have a communist individual in every business. Government controls the businesses where they go. That's not the world we look to for freedom.
BARTIROMO: Real quick on your tax plan. Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year. And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.
MCCARTHY: Some want to go to 90 percent. The understanding here --
BARTIROMO: Would that ever pass?
MCCARTHY: I don't know. If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.
BARTIROMO: But the President would veto it.
MCCARTHY: Let's hope. Yes, he would very much.
(CROSSTALKING)
BARTIROMO: What were you going to say? I'm sorry.
MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more. They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it. That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America. Are we moving toward socialism? Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?
I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union. We'll see if all of this comes up. Good to see you -- Congressman.
MCCARTHY: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.
LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: They just hit the tape -- Maria. Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate. Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.
Let's take a look at reaction. Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading. So that is a stock you want to watch today.
Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close. Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix. It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company. Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.
Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning. The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production. The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year. Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.
Let's go overseas. British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union. In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland. The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th. We'll see if that happens.
And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig. It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.
Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family. He also tried out riot gear with police. The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.
BARTIROMO: Ok. Thank you Lauren.
Coming up earnings are in focus this morning. Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning. We've got the details next up. The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.
And then the force is strong with these two, check them out. Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.
Back in a minute.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street. Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue. However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.
Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization. He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer. Good to see you -- sir. Thanks so much for joining us.
ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION: Hi, Maria. Good to be with you.
BARTIROMO: What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion. That was double the same period a year ago.
SCHIFFER: Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria. I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.
So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction. And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.
LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Eric -- Lindsey Bell here. Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us? That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business. Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?
SCHIFFER: That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed. But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS. But again, that's a very competitive area. But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.
ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating. Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else. There's a chase for content.
And then on the R&D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars. But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.
So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based. It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be. How do you see it?
SCHIFFER: Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.
It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed. But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow. They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.
And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins. But these are competitive areas. Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.
So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves. But we don't have full clarity on all the details.
BARTIROMO: Ok. What a growth story.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that. It just stinks to high heaven. This new -- I'm not beta. I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels. It is great. This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.
BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. And it's all about video. We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram. I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.
Are you on Instagram?
BELL: @LCBell.
BARTIROMO: Ok. Are you on Instagram?
WOLF: I'm not.
BARTIROMO: Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday. Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network. He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society."
So they've come along way. Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.
What a story over the last 15 years. Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?
SCHIFFER: Oh is this to me? Look, I think that it's an incredible story. I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.
BARTIROMO: He's got to.
SCHIFFER: That they caused. But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people. I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.
The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --
(CROSSTALKING)
BARTIROMO: They can't say they didn't sell our data. They sold our data. They sold us out, let's face it.
SCHIFFER: Absolutely. Of course they did.
BARTIROMO: Eric -- thank you so much today.
I mean it's an incredible story. We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers. Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning. It's good to see you, sir.
SCHIFFER: Thanks.
BARTIROMO: Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media. What they said, next up.
Then, heading south, not just for winter. More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills. Wait until you see the numbers.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning. It is Tuesday, February 5th. Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.
Viacom released mixed earnings this morning. The company beating on earnings per share but missed on revenue. The stock is down 1-1/2 percent right now. Disney and Snap among the other names reporting later today. We will bring you the very latest on earnings coming up.
The markets are expected to trade higher this morning certainly at the open. Futures indicating a gain of about 87 points on the Dow Industrials, a third of a percent. S&P is up 5-1/4 and the NASDAQ is up 20 points, a third of a percent.
This after a great day yesterday for stocks, the indices finishing at the highest close in two months with the Dow Industrials picking up 175 points. Three-quarters of one percent. The S&P was up 18, two-thirds of a percent and the NASDAQ was up 83 points, that was better than one percent.
In Europe this morning, gains across the board there as well. The FT-100 up about 90 points -- 97 points higher, 1-1/3 percent higher. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up one percent, 48 points higher and the DAX Index in Germany up 122 points, better than one percent.
Asian markets most of the markets closed in celebration of the Lunar New Year. It is the Chinese New Year and as you see all markets were closed with the exception of Japan. It was down a fraction.
We're on countdown mode to the State of the Union tonight. The president's expected to call for unity in tonight's address. After the recent government shutdown over border wall funding.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR, DONALD TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: He's calling for cooperation and he's calling for comity, c-o-m-i-t-y and also compromise.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: What's the state of the Trump administration? The state of the Trump administration is chaos.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Fox Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight. It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern. And we will be live throughout the speech and after.
Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State. I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.
Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl. The fallout coming up.
Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning. Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well. All those details coming up.
But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union. President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.
Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there. Good to see you both ladies. Thank you so much for joining us.
MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION: Of course.
JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY: Good morning.
BARTIROMO: Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush. Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this. What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?
GROSSMAN: Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it. It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.
I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process. That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink. So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.
BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump. But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.
DUPPLER: Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process. But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president. The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.
But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good. So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing. Talk about the tax cut. We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this. I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade. American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --
DUPPLER: Competitiveness.
MCDOWELL: -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.
Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade. When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.
DUPPLER: And Dagen --
MCDOWELL: And employment grew at 1.7 percent. The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be. And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table. That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.
DUPPLER: Exactly.
MCDOWELL: Because that will hurt investment in the venter.
BARTIROMO: Well, what you said earlier was so smart. He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going. You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?
MCDOWELL: Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.
DUPPLER: Exactly.
MCDOWELL: That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.
BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.
ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Is Jennifer still on?
BARTIROMO: Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.
WOLF: Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left. It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days. How would you take that as a speech writer? What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?
GROSSMAN: Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery. If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well. But we probably don't remember a single line.
What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room. One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands. It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.
BARTIROMO: Well, what about all these guess? I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address. Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.
Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake. Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal? Asking for a friend. Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate. The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though. What's your reaction to this, Mattie?
DUPPLER: Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners. You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math. She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending. But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it. We know that's simply not the case.
MCDOWELL: But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --
DUPPLER: Off about.
MCDOWELL: -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying. But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.
BARTIROMO: But there's also --
MCDOWELL: And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.
BARTIROMO: Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.
DUPPLR: I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --
BARTIROMO: There's not enough money.
DUPPLER: Exactly right. If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class. You need a vat. You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.
WOLF: Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.
DUPPLER: Right.
WOLF: That is Republicans and Democrats going there. That they want to see a tax on the rich.
DUPPLER: Right.
WOLF: So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.
MCDOWELL: And that President Trump once supported that idea.
DUPPLER: You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes. The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on. Frankly --
BARTIROMO: I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent. Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.
DUPPLER: Right. And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is. Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)
BARTIROMO: There you go. Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies. Thank you so much.
Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.
And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address. Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour. Join us for that special interview tomorrow.
First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states. They're leaving in droves. We've got the details next up.
Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World. Back in a minute.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.
LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Still talking about this, Maria. It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday. The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted. And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case. If we could, the facts were not there, period. Full stop.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SIMONETTI: In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case. Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.
We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000. The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country. One of the biggest winners is Miami. Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.
Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win. I guess it just doesn't get old. Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown. More than a million fans are expected. The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way. The team tweeted out this image. It shows -- it shows five championship trophies. You can see them right there on the plane's tail. They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.
And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida. So, there you have it.
BARTIROMO: A lot of stories there.
SIMONETTI: A lot of fun.
BARTIROMO: I lot of fun. I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states. I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen. What's your take on this? Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile. It will go where it's treated best.
MCDOWELL: No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion. Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.
So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York. Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.
BARTIROMO: I feel like that's what's happening in Texas. I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure. I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.
First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets. Slack makes it official yesterday, filing. We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market. Slack confirmed it is ready to go public. And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.
Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley. And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks for being here.
JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.
KELLEY: Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong. We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now. So, really, really robust.
BARTIROMO: So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else? What are the big ones?
KELLEY: Lots of them.
BARTIROMO: Airbnb.
KELLEY: Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.
WOLF: Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting? Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork. You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations. But where do you think these come out? Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?
KELLEY: I think so. I mean, the foundations are really strong. So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks. Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up. Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal. So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.
WOLF: Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?
KELLEY: That's a very good question.
BARTIROMO: Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.
KELLEY: Well, there's a race going on. Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first. Everybody wants to be first.
BARTIROMO: And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again. They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding. Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown. So, what's your take on that?
KELLEY: They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go. I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file. But there are companies pushing through right now.
WOLF: Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.
KELLEY: You have a direct listing.
BARTIROMO: Like Slack.
LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA: Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?
KELLEY: I think it's a handful. We'll have a handful of direct listing. These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital. But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.
BARTIROMO: Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public. So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there. Has that changed?
KELLEY: Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling. You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.
But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.
BARTIROMO: Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks? How do they perform after the IPO?
KELLEY: I think it is. You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game. If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned. But these companies are going to be around for the while. They're very big and disruptive.
BARTIROMO: Jackie, thank you so much. Jackie Kelley. We'll be right back.

MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.
I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, February 5th.
Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.
Earnings are in focus this morning. Google parent, Alphabet set to weigh on markets after last night's results. Investors are also watching other media companies like Viacom and Disney on tap today. Google parent Alphabet is lower but the rest of the market is strong today.
Take a look at futures indicating a very strong opening. Dow Industrials set to be up about 80 points, one-third of 1 percent; S&P 500 up 4.75 points, that's a fraction; and the Nasdaq up 16 points right now, quarter of a percent despite the weakness in Alphabet.
This after a very good day yesterday, gains across the board in fact. The Dow Industrials at the close yesterday up 175 points, three-quarters of 1 percent. The S&P 500 was up 18 at the close, two-thirds of a percent. And the Nasdaq up 83 points, better than 1 percent higher on Nasdaq. Big tech did well.
Global markets this morning mostly higher. Take a look at the European indices. FT 100 up 98 points, 1.5 percent. CAC 40 in Paris up 50 points, better than 1 percent. And the DAX index in Germany up 125 points. Better than 1 percent.
In Asia overnight. It is the lunar holiday. Most markets are closed for the Chinese New Year. However, Japan is open. And it was down a fraction.
It is celebrating the Year of the Pig. How China's President Xi Jinping rang in the New Year. We've got the details there coming up.
And we are in countdown to the State of the Union tonight. President Trump is set to tout the economy tonight. Many will be waiting to hear what the President says about border security and the national emergency.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: The President cannot be more clear that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency. It has never been his preferred option. At the same time, the President's made very clear that it's his first and solemn duty to the (INAUDIBLE) and he believes that includes securing the southern border.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: All the details coming up.
And you see that Viacom is just reporting earnings. It's on your screen there -- better than expected on the earnings line at $1.12 a share versus -- much better than the estimate. Revenue however is a miss at $3.09 billion versus an estimate of $3.12 billion. We will take a look at the stock coming up.
Squaring off on social media meanwhile, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trading barbs over taxes and football on Twitter. Wait until you see this.
Patriots on parade, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning. Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disneyworld.
All those stories coming up this morning.
But first our top story this hour -- the highly anticipated State of the Union address. President Trump is set to address the nation tonight highlighting key issues facing Americans and emphasizing the administration's economic success throughout his time in office.
It comes amid a brutal fight at the southern border and as the President weighs announcing a national emergency to fund a wall.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the President's policies ahead of tonight's speech. Watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: What's the state of the Trump administration? The state of the Trump administration is chaos. It is sad -- the State of the Union. And let me just say, the number one reason the State of the Union has such woes is the President. I hope he changes in the next two years.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is California Congressman, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman it's always a pleasure. Thank you so much for joining us.
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Thanks for having me.
BARTIROMO: Is it chaos? I mean walk us -- you're there. You're the minority leader. Tell us what government looks like today.
MCCARTHY: Is it chaos with our new jobs report last month, wages going up, unemployment low, renegotiating NAFTA. We're seeing new growth that we've never seen before. I mean we probably have never been stronger economically in the last 50 years.
The challenge is think about what the Democrats are celebrating. Nancy Pelosi now believes in no border security. What does that mean to human trafficking that they stop going along the way? They celebrate status quo. So it does not solve the DACA problem.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCCARTHY: They are just opposed to anything that Trump wants to offer, even though that that's good for America.
BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean they say that they are for border security. But when I asked, you know, your colleagues on the left, why didn't you vote for Kate's law, why didn't you vote for the end of sanctuary cities, why didn't you vote for a wall -- and we know that Nancy Pelosi has a wall in your state, in her state separating Tijuana from San Diego.
So is this all just resist because they hate him? They want him out?
MCCARTHY: Yes. Because if you look since we built that wall in California, illegal crossings have dropped more than 95 percent.
BARTIROMO: In the -- between Tijuana and San Diego.
MCCARTHY: Yes. And then if you got to Yuma, Arizona. You got to El Paso. El Paso is now one of the safest large cities in America. So there's an ability to do this
But what people don't quite realize, the amount of individuals they catch from human trafficking coming across the border, the amount of drugs -- there's a place that we find common ground.
And remember what the President offered, let's solve the DACA issue at the same time let's solve the border issue at the same time. And I think that's what America look for -- common ground. But Nancy Pelosi wanted nothing to happen.
BARTIROMO: Well, you had conversations. How are the conversations going now? Can you give us the status check in terms of what's gone on so far this week? You've got another two weeks left before another potential government shutdown.
MCCARTHY: They've only met one time. And they had opening statements and then Speaker Pelosi came out and said no money for a wall. Even though Democrats and herself have voted for this time before. But now that the President has offered it, they want to oppose it.
BARTIROMO: What are you going to do? I mean the President is expected to call for unity tonight. Unity -- which I mean you -- I think the American people want unity amid these deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security.
Is a compromise even feasible? And is this just the beginning of what is to come for the next two years? That everything your team goes and puts forth, everything that the President wants is met with resistance?
MCCARTHY: I hope not. I hope we make a pledge to one another that we put people before politics. We can always have a campaign. We can always have where we disagree philosophically but let's put America first. And let's sit together and find ways that we can find common ground because that's the way our government is actually designed to work
Nobody is going to get 100 percent of what they want. But unfortunately the Speaker wants 100 percent or nothing. But that's really not where all her members are. More than 60 members on the Democrats' side said they would support some form of the wall.
BARTIROMO: Well, that's a good point because I want to ask you about that. Is there a movement within the Democrats right now to break with the Speaker?
MCCARTHY: I think so. But the problem is, what Speaker Pelosi does, she has such a grip on her party where now it's immoral from a standpoint to even talk about a wall when they voted for it, when she has people in her own leadership team that supports it.
BARTIROMO: Yes. Border patrol on high alert right now as we speak because you've got the most recent migrant caravan arriving at the southern border. I mean the timing is incredible, Congressman.
California Speaker Pelosi's home state, she says the wall is immoral and we know we show this wall all the time between Tijuana and San Diego. And I keep asking the question, if you tear down that wall, will the people in Tijuana assimilate into San Diego? It's pretty obvious, right?
(CROSSTALKING)
MCCARTHY: Yes. These caravans that are coming, Tijuana does not want them either, the mayor if you talk down there. This is what's really backwards in their thinking. You've got to have some form of barrier in certain areas. And you've got to have a structure to be able to do it. I think everybody in America believes that.
The President says that's not the only thing that he wants to do. Yes, he wants to put technology in other areas to be able to protect it but he also wants to deal with the DACA issue. And the Democrats are saying no.
BARTIROMO: So, do you think that there could be an agreement with a solution for the DACA recipients?
MCCARTHY: I can guarantee you this. If Speaker Pelosi would get out of the way we would have an agreement in less than 30 minutes. But she wants to make everything political and that's what's causing the problem.
We've got so much more to do. We've got infrastructure. We've got the negotiations where the President sat down with Mexico and Canada and came up with a better agreement for America.
BARTIROMO: Is that going to be approved though? I mean I speak with a number of Democrat congressmen who say, you know what, I'm not voting for USMCA. So what happens if you can't ratify that?
MCCARTHY: America loses in that process, because this makes America stronger in the negotiation. Why would they oppose that?
BARTIROMO: A lot of focus tonight is going to on the guests at the speech. The White House inviting 11-year-old Joshua Trump who has been bullied because of his last name. Democrats are getting political. Some of the guests will include furloughed federal workers, critics of Brett Kavanaugh, undocumented people who worked at Trump golf clubs.
Tell us about that. I mean how important are these guests that everybody is bringing to make a point?
MCCARTHY: Well, I think they invite these guests to try to get some publicity or something else. I think it's important that all of us are together in one place, to hear from the President and actually work together to solve these problems.
We're going to have differences of opinion but we can find common ground and we've got big challenges in front of us. Think about how much we've been able to achieve with getting the tax bill passed, our economy's stronger than we've ever seen in the last 50 years. We're rebuilding our military to confront the challenges that we see from China and Russia continuing to grow.
We've got an energy independence growing in America like we've never had before. So we're stronger when it deals with the Middle East and others. America is in a point to make the next century ours. The challenge would be if politics are going to hold us back from the exceptionalism that America can fully achieve.
BARTIROMO: The backdrop feels good, you're absolutely right. What about the issue around trade? China, for example. A lot of people want to see a deal done.
But do you think that the President should say okay to a deal that China just buys more stuff?
MCCARTHY: No.
BARTIROMO: We heard yesterday the Chinese are willing to buy more grain and soybean. What about the IP issue? Is there going to be any accountability for all of those decades that China has stolen America's IP, intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.
MCCARTHY: They've stolen so much of America's technology and thought and the process. This is a fundamental president that has finally stood up where someone has had -- we should have done it before. And we're in a stronger position to do it than ever before.
And I think this President is right. We're finding China for the first time coming to the table. But I do not believe the President will agree to some weak deal. This is the moment that we have to confront them and actually change the course of the direction that we're going.
BARTIROMO: Now, the steel and aluminum tariffs are still in place. You heard us on the program. Dagen McDowell has mentioned this a number of times, she thinks it's hurting the economy. Has it hurt the economy?
MCCARTHY: There's areas that it hurts. There're areas that it supports. If you look at the steel facilities opening up, with the cost of where it's going. But when I look overall, what the President is doing is looking long-term. Will we be stronger long-term? Will there be more American jobs?
Remember -- what was the last report that came in, more than 300,000?
BARTIROMO: Yes -- 304,000.
(CROSSTALKING)
MCCARTHY: -- 100,000.And we are dealing with a shutdown at the same time. I mean this president has put the American worker first. Wages have gone up 3 percent, the highest in the process.
So we're stronger where we're going. But what China's been doing ever since they got in the WTO, they have not conformed to what the Western world has looked at -- about the rule of law.
BARTIROMO: Yes.
MCCARTHY: So this is more than buying more soybeans. This is what the world should look like and is it fair and is the rule of law going to win.
BARTIROMO: Yes. And I asked the question earlier. If China really wants the world to trust them in terms of using their telecom equipment from Huawei and ZTE, it's going to have to get the world's trust.
MCCARTHY: They have a closed society. They still have a communist individual in every business. Government controls the businesses where they go. That's not the world we look to for freedom.
BARTIROMO: Real quick on your tax plan. Because obviously it did stimulate growth last year. And we see the numbers -- we're talking about a 3 percent grower for the year we think.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70 percent on the tippy, tippy top, she said.
MCCARTHY: Some want to go to 90 percent. The understanding here --
BARTIROMO: Would that ever pass?
MCCARTHY: I don't know. If they have more congresswoman such as herself, maybe it would.
BARTIROMO: But the President would veto it.
MCCARTHY: Let's hope. Yes, he would very much.
(CROSSTALKING)
BARTIROMO: What were you going to say? I'm sorry.
MCCARTHY: Well, the challenge with what they see we're letting people keep more of what they earn to invest more. They want government to have greater control of your life, more of your money, and every aspect of it. That goes to a philosophical debate that's happening in America. Are we moving toward socialism? Are we looking to a more freedom in free markets?
I think that's a much bigger debate of the differences of what we're seeing in congress today and the future of America.
BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. We're looking forward to tonight, the State of the Union. We'll see if all of this comes up. Good to see you -- Congressman.
MCCARTHY: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy there.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Viacom is out with mixed quarterly earnings. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now -- Lauren.
LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: They just hit the tape -- Maria. Viacom reporting an adjusted profit of $1.12 a share -- that beat the street's estimate. Revenue of just about $3.1 billion that missed expectations on falling domestic ad sales.
Let's take a look at reaction. Shares of Viacom under pressure, down 1.5 percent in premarket trading. So that is a stock you want to watch today.
Also Disney -- we get earnings from Walt Disney after the close. Investors will be looking for what Disney will say about the rollout of Disney Plus, its new streaming service to compete with Netflix. It's aimed at those rivals and analysts at Morgan Stanley call 2019 a, quote, transformational year for the company. Shares of Walt Disney which is a Dow component trading up half of 1 percent at $112.45 a share in the premarket.
Let's take a look at British Petroleum beating earnings estimates this morning. The oil company's fourth quarter profit jumping more than 65 percent compared to a year ago following a sharp rise in oil and gas production. The company is nearing the end of its payments related to the 2010 Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Payments last year totaled $3.2 billion and BP is expected to pay another $2 billion this year. Shares up almost 4 percent in the premarket.
Let's go overseas. British Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to shore up support in Northern Ireland for her plan to leave the European Union. In a speech to business leaders May will try to reassure people in Northern Ireland that she can secure a deal that avoids a hard border with Ireland. The Prime Minister will then visit Brussels Thursday for talks with its president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The U.K. is due to leave the E.U. on March 29th. We'll see if that happens.
And Happy New Year to many in East Asia, celebrations underway in China, Korea and other countries welcoming the Year of the Pig. It marks the year 4717 on the lunar calendar.
Chinese President Xi Jinping celebrated by cooking dumplings with family. He also tried out riot gear with police. The Chinese military also sent a holiday video message to Taiwan, showing off its bombers and its fighter jets -- Maria.
BARTIROMO: Ok. Thank you Lauren.
Coming up earnings are in focus this morning. Despite a beat on Alphabet, the stock is under pressure this morning. We've got the details next up. The stock is down 2.5 percent right now.
And then the force is strong with these two, check them out. Patriots Tom Brady and Julian Edelman fresh off of their Super Bowl victory showcase some new skills in Disney world.
Back in a minute.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Welcome back.
Once again, earnings really driving the action on Wall Street. Google parent Alphabet posted a big jump in revenue. However the stock is under pressure amid rising expenses.
Joining us right now is the chairman and CEO of the Patriarch Organization. He's the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, Eric Schiffer. Good to see you -- sir. Thanks so much for joining us.
ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PATRIARCH ORGANIZATION: Hi, Maria. Good to be with you.
BARTIROMO: What did you make of Alphabet's quarter, on capital expenditure the company spent $25.4 billion. That was double the same period a year ago.
SCHIFFER: Look, they're trying to grow -- Maria. I mean they're investing and trying to get another engine other than advertising which has been the, you know, the core of Google and Alphabet for years.
So I think a lot of people are not paying attention to the fact that they're looking at a much longer range view of the company and they recognize that you have to invest to be able to grow and they certainly got revenue numbers out of different divisions, cloud and hardware, et cetera, in moving in the right direction. And I think people wanted to see less spending for more margin but the investments are going to pay off and I think that they're making the right, smart moves for the long term.
LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Eric -- Lindsey Bell here. Just on the cloud point, can you dig into that a little bit for us? That's one area they're really investing in but they're lagging still well behind Amazon and Microsoft's Azure business. Do you see them catching up to those guys any time soon?
SCHIFFER: That's a tough one to be able to catch up with because they have such legacy relationships and people that are already committed. But I think that they're going to make incremental moves there over time and there are other things they can do to try to draw people back away from Azure, away from AWS. But again, that's a very competitive area. But areas -- but they do have opportunities to grow there, in my opinion.
ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Eric, I found the numbers quite fascinating. Because one, it feels like there's a chase for content, so not surprising YouTube is spending more money because we see the battle with Netflix and coming up and Disney and everyone else. There's a chase for content.
And then on the R&D side, you know, things like Waymo and artificial intelligence and, you know, obviously their driverless cars. But where it seems they're getting hurt is that their handheld devices just aren't really resonating, so they have to pay, you know, fees to literally -- to there I would say quasi competitors or some say their strategic partners.
So it seems to me that where they're spending money is much more broad-based. It's hard to get a real feel where the ROI is going to be. How do you see it?
SCHIFFER: Well, look, I think with YouTube, they're certainly investing in content to begin to draw more people in and build relationships with those that are already committed to other services and begin to move people over.
It's a little bit fuzzy to understand where and how all of it is distributed. But I think that what's clear in my opinion is that these are areas that are -- that can continue to grow. They certainly recognize that by making the right investments, they're going to be able to get traction and the revenue -- look, you look at the revenue and the revenue numbers certainly speak.
And at some point, I mean, if they wanted to cut off the capital expenditures and costs, you'd see the margins. But these are competitive areas. Certainly Waymo requires significant capital investment to be able to get the scale that they're going to want to have, the artificial intelligence whole arena is very costly at this point.
So I do think that they're making -- in my opinion, they're making the smart moves. But we don't have full clarity on all the details.
BARTIROMO: Ok. What a growth story.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Eventually Google's going to need to break out what is going on at YouTube and mark my words, because I have warned people that the direct TV, Direct TV now streaming live television service is horrendous and finally its numbers are showing that. It just stinks to high heaven. This new -- I'm not beta. I'm testing this new live YouTube -- live TV service, it's about 60 channels. It is great. This is going to be a juggernaut and all the other streaming services better look out.
BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. And it's all about video. We just shot a video a minute ago on Instagram. I've been really active on Instagram so check out @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell.
Are you on Instagram?
BELL: @LCBell.
BARTIROMO: Ok. Are you on Instagram?
WOLF: I'm not.
BARTIROMO: Facebook turned 15 years old yesterday. Remember 15 years ago when we were first covering this, Zuckerberg takes the opportunity defend social network. He writes this, people overly emphasize the negative consequences of the Internet, criticize the idea that the Internet and Facebook are harmful to society."
So they've come along way. Remember when Google went public, what was it $75 a share, I think.
What a story over the last 15 years. Your reaction, real quick, before you go -- Eric?
SCHIFFER: Oh is this to me? Look, I think that it's an incredible story. I think that Zuckerberg is trying to go on offense to reshape what has been tremendous negative sentiment over the last year, year and-a-half.
BARTIROMO: He's got to.
SCHIFFER: That they caused. But at the same time, I think his strategy in doing it I think upset a lot of people. I mean he tried to conflate Facebook with the Internet in trying to distract and look at the internet's overall patterns when in fact, he didn't take accountability.
The reality is, there are things that they did that were not proper, that certainly hurt consumers, certainly --
(CROSSTALKING)
BARTIROMO: They can't say they didn't sell our data. They sold our data. They sold us out, let's face it.
SCHIFFER: Absolutely. Of course they did.
BARTIROMO: Eric -- thank you so much today.
I mean it's an incredible story. We now know all of the sharing was so that they could make money with advertisers. Eric Schiffer -- thanks for weighing in this morning. It's good to see you, sir.
SCHIFFER: Thanks.
BARTIROMO: Coming up next, we're taking on the tax debate, lawmakers Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Crenshaw square off on social media. What they said, next up.
Then, heading south, not just for winter. More and more home buyers are heading to Florida to save big on their tax bills. Wait until you see the numbers.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us this Tuesday morning. It is Tuesday, February 5th. Your top stories right now 7:33 a.m. on the East Coast.

(END VIDEO CLIP)
BARTIROMO: Fox Business will have special coverage of the State of the Union tonight. It all starts with Lou Dobbs at 07:00 p.m. Eastern. And we will be live throughout the speech and after.
Then tomorrow morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be live in Washington tomorrow morning with special guests including the Secretary of State. I will sit down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow morning at this time, so do join us.
Then there's this, a Twitter fight to tell you about, Congressman Dan Crenshaw and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez battling it out on social media over taxes and the Super Bowl. The fallout coming up.
Plus, Patriots pride, the team celebrates its Super Bowl win in Boston this morning. Tom Brady and Julian Edelman feeling the force during a trip to Disney World as well. All those details coming up.
But first our top story this half an hour, the State of the Union. President Trump is expected to tout the economy tonight as well as make a plea for unity amid the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over border security among other things.
Joining us now to talk about what we can expect is former speech writer from President George H.W. Bush, and Atlas Society CEO, Jennifer Grossman joining us at the National Tax Payers Union, Mattie Duppler is here, senior fellow there. Good to see you both ladies. Thank you so much for joining us.
MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAX PAYERS UNION: Of course.
JENNIFER GROSSMAN, CEO, ATLAS SOCIETY: Good morning.
BARTIROMO: Jennifer, you were speech writer for President H.W. Bush. Tell us first what goes into writing a speech like this. What do you think the president will be talking about tonight?
GROSSMAN: Well, the first thing that happens is about at least five weeks out, sometimes as long as two months out the speech writer and the team sits down with the president, gets his vision, writes an outline, and then goes and writes to it. It's often considered a very plum assignment but it's really not the most fun speech to write because it ends up being written by a committee.
I always say that it's a speech where style and fanatic integrity is sacrificed on the altar of the staffing process. That's when it goes out to all of the agencies and you just have an accumulated seat of editorial ink. So, it's a -- it's an honor to be a part of it but it's really not a fun speech for speech writers.
BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess Mattie want to put your best foot forward and talk about the positives out there like the economy for President Trump. But you can't ignore some of the elephant in the room like the government was shut down for 35 days.
DUPPLER: Right, Jennifer has detailed a very long process. But we know there's been a titanic shift in the last month for this president. The 35 day shutdown really has set the stage for a State of the -- State of the Union that's going to be different from any other.
But those themes of unity and greatness, I mean, Americans never feel more unified than when their own personal circumstances are feeling good. So I would like to see the president really emphasize how well the economy is doing. Talk about the tax cut. We've had a lot of politicians kind of shy away from this. I think they should be embracing some of these economic agenda items that have really put American footing on the map in a different way for the first time in a decade. American workers would like to hear that reassurance I think from the president tonight.
DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: And how the -- not just the individual tax cuts, but it was the corporate tax cuts did --
DUPPLER: Competitiveness.
MCDOWELL: -- did boost capital investment in 2018 because of productivity increases, wages are growing and should continue to grow even faster.
Just last month, average hourly earnings were growing at 3.2 percent, the fastest in a decade. When you factor in lower inflation, you're talking about real wage growth at about four percent in this country.
DUPPLER: And Dagen --
MCDOWELL: And employment grew at 1.7 percent. The Wall Street Journal goes through all of this but what his next steps should be. And the Journal suggest, the editorial board, that he take the car tariffs off the table. That you need China and you need Europe to grow, stop threatening them with car tariffs.
DUPPLER: Exactly.
MCDOWELL: Because that will hurt investment in the venter.
BARTIROMO: Well, what you said earlier was so smart. He's going to have to come up with an idea to keep this going. You know, how do you keep three percent going in the next two years?
MCDOWELL: Get a deal done with China and then spend the next two years making sure that China abides by what it agreed to.
DUPPLER: Exactly.
MCDOWELL: That's the one thing that the Journal was pointing out this morning.
BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.
ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Is Jennifer still on?
BARTIROMO: Jennifer Grossman, sure she is.
WOLF: Jennifer, the question just as a speech writer, when you have the theme that the -- that the White House and the president once called unity, right after a government shutdown, right after whether -- you know, either side wants to admit it or not, pretty much a blue wave during the midterms and now what would be deemed by the Democrats certainly a shift to the left. It seems more of a word than the ability to really transcend that based on what's happened the last 35 days. How would you take that as a speech writer? What would be some of the themes that you would think about to tout?
GROSSMAN: Well, I think at the end of the day, the words are actually less important than the delivery. If you think back to last year's State of the Union, I think we can all remember it well. But we probably don't remember a single line.
What we do remember is the delivery, we remember the dynamics in the room. One of the best moments for the president of last year's speech was when he was just factually talking about historically low unemployment numbers among African Americans and the Black Caucus just sat on their hands. It made them look terrible and it made him look very magnanimous by contrast.
BARTIROMO: Well, what about all these guess? I mean, there's a big focus at tonight's address. Freshmen Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has announced that she will bring the activist who confronted Senator Jeff Flake over his Brett Kavanaugh confirmation vote last year to the State of the Union.
Remember, the activist that went in the elevator after Jeff Flake. Texas Congressman Dan Crenshaw took a jab at AOC's proposed 70 percent income tax, tweeting this, should someone propose a 70 percent tax on the Patriots so that NFL competition is more fair and equal? Asking for a friend. Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Crenshaw, tweeting this, the average NFL salary is $2.1 million, so most players would never experience a 70 percent rate. The owners who refuse to hire Kaepernick would though. What's your reaction to this, Mattie?
DUPPLER: Well, it's interesting to me that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez is tipping her hand a little bit, saying that a $2.1 million salary wouldn't be enough to qualify you for her 70 percent top rate, just the owners. You know, it displays that this is policy making driven by envy and not by actual math. She's talking about trillions of dollars in new spending. But she's trying to argue that a new marginal tax rate will pay for it. We know that's simply not the case.
MCDOWELL: But can we just say Dan Crenshaw was making a joke --
DUPPLER: Off about.
MCDOWELL: -- that fell flat, that didn't make any sense, it made zero sense what Congressman Crenshaw was saying. But then, AOC and all her supporters took it literally and got mad and had to lecture the congressman about the way that the tax code works.
BARTIROMO: But there's also --
MCDOWELL: And the -- and so the whole thing is just headache inducing.
BARTIROMO: Yes, but the bigger point is you're never going to get the money she's looking for for her green project with just taxing $10 million.
DUPPLR: I mean, that's the dirty little secret for the left, the notion that you can just tax millionaires --
BARTIROMO: There's not enough money.
DUPPLER: Exactly right. If you want a welfare state like the -- like some of these countries in Europe, you need a tax that hits the middle class. You need a vat. You need to tax that people at lower incomes are paying and people -- the left simply doesn't want to admit that.
WOLF: Mattie, just to ask a quick question though, 75 percent of this country is actually supportive of the marginal tax rate moving up to where AOC said at 70 percent.
DUPPLER: Right.
WOLF: That is Republicans and Democrats going there. That they want to see a tax on the rich.
DUPPLER: Right.
WOLF: So it's hard to beat that literally you're seeing a movement that's more in agreement with her on that.
MCDOWELL: And that President Trump once supported that idea.
DUPPLER: You see those numbers fall though when you educate Americans about how much taxes are actually paid by the upper class and who's actually paying those taxes. The fact the top one percent is actually shouldering most of the federal income tax burden is something that we need to educate Americans on. Frankly --
BARTIROMO: I think it's 45 percent, the top one percent paying 45 percent. Top 10 percent pay 71 percent.
DUPPLER: Right. And Democrats are -- have talked a big game on taxes about putting their money where their mouth is. Remember President Obama the most progressive president we've ever had signed 85 percent in the Bush tax cuts in the (INAUDIBLE)
BARTIROMO: There you go. Jennifer Grossman, Mattie Duppler, great to see you both ladies. Thank you so much.
Stay tune to Fox Business, we've got live coverage of the president's State of the Union tonight, kicking off at 7:00 p.m.
And then, tomorrow I will be live from Washington D.C., with the highlights from the president's address. Interviewing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the 07:00 a.m. hour. Join us for that special interview tomorrow.
First though, next up, right here, moving money south, lawmakers are sounding the alarm over homeowners leaving high tax states. They're leaving in droves. We've got the details next up.
Then, showcasing new skills off the field, Patriot's Tom Brady and Julian Edelman using the force while in Disney World. Back in a minute.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Jim Comey raising eyebrows this morning about the Clinton e-mail investigation. Lauren Simonetti on headlines now, Lauren.
LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Still talking about this, Maria. It was during a town hall meeting in Sarasota, Florida yesterday. The former FBI chief explaining his conclusion in the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JAMES COMEY, FORMER DIRECTOR, FBI: There is zero chance -- zero chance that the -- on the facts in the Hillary Clinton case that she will be prosecuted. And you are out of your mind if you don't think the FBI wanted to make a case. If we could, the facts were not there, period. Full stop.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
SIMONETTI: In July 2016 Jim Comey said the FBI would not recommend criminal charges in the case. Well, he later reopened the investigation, then closed it again, just days before the 2016 presidential election.
We have new data and it suggests that people of high tax states are increasingly moving to Florida after last year's tax law capped deductions at $10,000. The real estate firm Zillow says home values in lower tax areas have been rising faster than other parts of the country. One of the biggest winners is Miami. Miami experiencing more activity than usual from buyers from states like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois, from the high tax states.
Well, in a few hours from now, Patriots fans will celebrate their team's sixth Super Bowl win. I guess it just doesn't get old. Boston will fire up the duck boats at 11:00 a.m. to carry the team downtown. More than a million fans are expected. The Patriots are going to need an update to their plane, by the way. The team tweeted out this image. It shows -- it shows five championship trophies. You can see them right there on the plane's tail. They've got to figure out a way to add number six I guess.
And then there's this, Tom Brady and Julian Edelman they traveled to a galaxy far, far away, dueling with lightsabers at the new Star Wars Park in Florida. So, there you have it.
BARTIROMO: A lot of stories there.
SIMONETTI: A lot of fun.
BARTIROMO: I lot of fun. I love this story about the taxes and how people are leaving high tax states. I know there's a piece about Andrew Cuomo in the Post today, Dagen. What's your take on this? Because we knew this was going to happen, money is mobile. It will go where it's treated best.
MCDOWELL: No state income tax in Florida and because the cap on $10,000 in the state and local tax deduction, that New York has seen its income tax revenue plunge by $2.3 billion. Just since he introduced -- this is Cuomo, his new budget last month.
So, basically, he's coming in with this big budget, and he's saying that they need to cut -- they need to cut spending because of the drop in the income tax revenue here in New York. Down in Florida, the danger is that all the lefty liberal Democrats move to Florida and then vote in tax policies and regulatory policies that they fled here in the northeast which is a concern.
BARTIROMO: I feel like that's what's happening in Texas. I feel like it's happening in Dallas for sure. I don't know about all of taxes but we're going to talk about that.
First though, the IPO market is heating up, we expected this, 2019 set to be a big year for companies hitting the markets. Slack makes it official yesterday, filing. We'll take a look at the state of the IPO market, right here.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BARTIROMO: Well, this year is set to be a big one for the IPO market. Slack confirmed it is ready to go public. And it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The professional chat platform expecting to not go the traditional route and will directly list its shares.
Joining us right now is E.Y. Americas IPO markets leader, Jackie Kelley. And Jackie, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks for being here.
JACKIE KELLEY, IPO MARKETS LEADER, E.Y. AMERICAS: Thank you.
BARTIROMO: Characterize what you're seeing out there in the IPO market.
KELLEY: Yes, the IPO market is a really, really strong. We have a number of companies that had been lining up since last fall, and are in the SEC registration process and we have them listing right now. So, really, really robust.
BARTIROMO: So, it's Slack, it's Uber, Pinterest, what else? What are the big ones?
KELLEY: Lots of them.
BARTIROMO: Airbnb.
KELLEY: Assume everybody's lining up right now frankly because the momentum is so strong and no one wants to miss out on the window.
WOLF: Yes, let me ask you something, do you feel that the valuations are being priced -- will be priced where the market's expecting? Because you have on one side -- you know, names like Palatin, WeWork. You know, trading at much higher levels than the secondary's trading based on expectations. But where do you think these come out? Do you think there's going to be momentum in the stock as well?
KELLEY: I think so. I mean, the foundations are really strong. So last year, you know, we were all a little nervous with how the market corrections and interest rates and everything were performing and impacting stocks. Today, Vix is low, you know, equity markets have picked up. Things have really stabilized in the markets and corporate performance on tech companies have been phenomenal. So, that foundation is really going to propel us as we go into the market.
WOLF: Who do you think will be the first one that actually comes?
KELLEY: That's a very good question.
BARTIROMO: Everybody wants Uber all the exchanges.
KELLEY: Well, there's a race going on. Honestly, you hear behind the scenes these guys talking, who wants to be first. Everybody wants to be first.
BARTIROMO: And you said the window, they better get in there quick because the government could shut down again. They got 10 days before the deadline for an agreement on border wall funding. Some of the IPOs were delayed because of the shutdown. So, what's your take on that?
KELLEY: They're getting pushed through, the ones that want to go. I mean, some have made decisions that are just going to get there (INAUDIBLE) numbers in there and re-file. But there are companies pushing through right now.
WOLF: Some of them are bypassing the exchanges right.
KELLEY: You have a direct listing.
BARTIROMO: Like Slack.
LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENTSTRATEGIST, CFRA: Is that -- do you see expect a lot more of that to come?
KELLEY: I think it's a handful. We'll have a handful of direct listing. These are companies that don't need -- or need or want capital. But I think that yes, companies are definitely pushing through right now.
BARTIROMO: Renaissance Capital wrote a piece about how even in a tough market at the end of the year companies were lining up to go -- to go public. So, tell us about the private money that's involved here and why maybe for a long time these companies didn't need to go public because there was so much venture capital money out there. Has that changed?
KELLEY: Yes, there's still a significant amount of private capital out there and that is completely an option you're company that's scaling. You need a lot of capital to grow, that's still available.
But you know, interest rates are rising and things are shifting and investors are now saying I've been in these deals 10 years, I want out.
BARTIROMO: Do you think that once they go public, that is a good opportunity to get in and buy those stocks? How do they perform after the IPO?
KELLEY: I think it is. You know, this is a -- this is a long-term game. If you take a short term focus, maybe it won't just play out like you planned. But these companies are going to be around for the while. They're very big and disruptive.
BARTIROMO: Jackie, thank you so much. Jackie Kelley. We'll be right back.

Writer Peggy Noonan said Ocasio-Cortez, D-N. Y. , "had a rare bad night, looking not spirited, warm and original as usual but sullen, teenaged and at a loss.

Ocasio-Cortez, who is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, called Trump's speech "unsettling" and said the president didn't offer "any plan" for the nation's future.
Ocasio-Cortez sat with a group of Democratic women wearing white to show how Democrats had won a majority in the House during the midterm elections, and that women's economic security is a priority. The color choice also was meant to honor the women's suffrage movement that led to the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.

Full text: The Atlantic 's Jemele Hill tonight apologized for a tweet she posted about President Donald Trump and said she was absolutely not calling for violence. Hill joked in a tweet that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez should yell out "GETCHO HAND OUT MY POCKET" at Trump during the State of the Union. The line is a reference to a phrase shouted just before the assassination of Malcolm X .
Hill took down the tweet and apologized for "breathing life into such an absurd assumption" that she would make an call for violence against Trump, noting other times she's used the line in a joking manner:
Glad you asked. When I tweeted "GETCHO HAND OUT MY POCKET," in no way was I suggesting any physical harm to the president. I have used this phrase many times in my Twitter history, always in lighthearted ways, and removed from the context of the movie. https://t.co/2uVVCvVfAr
-- Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) February 6, 2019
Please, allow me to retort ... https://t.co/K9q9YVUmsq
-- Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) February 6, 2019
Let me be clear: I have often disagreed with many of the president's policies, his behavior and rhetoric, but I would never call for violence against him, or any person. I apologize for breathing life into such an absurd assumption.
-- Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) February 7, 2019
And that's why I took it down. I don't need to dig in on this unnecessarily. If there's a chance someone could arrive at that conclusion, I'd rather just say I'm sorry and move on. https://t.co/sDEoQ8gsVW
-- Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) February 7, 2019
So, FYI .. i literally have used GETCHO HAND OUT OF MY POCKET a bunch of other times on Twitter, and always in a manner where you want to escape or distract from a situation. Never in a way that was harmful or malicious. pic.twitter.com/Hk7JLvwrdV

Unveiling a 'Green New Deal,' And Ambition on a Vast Scale

WASHINGTON -- Liberal Democrats put flesh on their "Green New Deal" slogan on Thursday with a sweeping resolution intended to redefine the national debate on climate change by calling for the United States to eliminate additional emissions of carbon by 2030.
The measure, drafted by freshman Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, is intended to answer the demand, by the party's restive base, for a grand strategy that combats climate change, creates jobs and offers an affirmative response to the challenge to core party values posed by President Trump.
The resolution has more breadth than detail and is so ambitious that Republicans greeted it with derision. Its legislative prospects are bleak in the foreseeable future; Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has no plan to bring the resolution in its current form to the floor for a vote, according to a Democratic leadership aide with direct knowledge of her plans.
But as a blueprint for liberal ambition, it was breathtaking. It includes a 10-year commitment to convert "100 percent of the power demand in the United States" to "clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources," to upgrade "all existing buildings" to meet energy efficiency requirements, and to expand high-speed rail so broadly that most air travel would be rendered obsolete.
The initiative, introduced as nonbinding resolutions in the House and Senate, is tethered to an infrastructure program that its authors say could create millions of new "green jobs," while guaranteeing health care, "a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security" to every American.
"Climate change and our environmental challenges are the biggest existential threats to our way of life," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Thursday. "We must be as ambitious and innovative in our solutions as possible."
Mr. Markey added, "We will save all of creation by engaging in massive job creation."
The resolution, modeled on Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s, will not move in its current form, but some ideas could advance as part of more modest legislation to address the climate crisis. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the chief architect of the deal, is not part of a new special select committee on climate change. She and Ms. Pelosi's office said that she had been offered a seat on the committee but that she declined it, an assertion confirmed by an aide to Ms. Pelosi.
"Frankly, I haven't seen it," the speaker told reporters when asked about the Green New Deal proposal during her weekly media availability at the Capitol on Thursday. "But I do know it is enthusiastic, and we welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there."
Ms. Pelosi is likely mindful of her own past mistakes. A decade ago she pushed the last major climate change measure hard, an ambitious bill to cap emissions of climate-warming pollution, then allow industries to trade emissions credits on a pollution credit market. Through force of will, she got the cap-and-trade measure through the House, only to see it die in the Senate without a vote. The next year, Democrats were swept from power, in part because of that vote and the Republicans' framing of it as a stealth tax hike.
In that Congress, she had a Democratic Senate and a Democratic president, Barack Obama. This time, she has Mr. Trump, a president who calls climate change a hoax, and a Senate in the control of Mitch McConnell, a Republican majority leader from the coal state of Kentucky.
But on Thursday, she was also intent on letting her critics on the left know about her own past efforts, adding that she had made climate change the "flagship issue" of her first speakership.
Proponents of the Green New Deal insisted that Democrats were unified. Both Mr. Markey and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez praised Ms. Pelosi as a "leader" on climate change, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she was not offended by Ms. Pelosi's description of the Green New Deal in an interview with Politico on Wednesday as the "green dream, or whatever they call it."
"I think it is a green dream," Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. "I will not allow our caucus to be divided by whatever narrative."
Republicans seized on the proposal with relish, portraying the entire resolution as absurd.
"The socialist Democrats are off to a great start with the roll out of their ridiculous Green New Deal today!" said Bob Salera, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the political arm of House Republicans, who called the idea "zany."
The Republican National Committee derided it as "a socialist wish list."
But Democratic candidates for the presidency did not shy away from it once details emerged. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, quickly sent out a fund-raising appeal, declaring: "For too long, we have been governed by lawmakers who are beholden to Big Oil and Big Coal. They have refused to act on climate change. So it's on us to speak the truth, rooted in science fact, not science fiction."
Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York; Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey; and Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, also co-sponsored the measure, which has early support from about 60 House and Senate Democrats.
For all of the resolution's audacity, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Markey also steered clear of several thorny issues, and there were even signs of concessions to moderate Democrats and Republicans interested in working on clean energy issues.
For example, the resolution does not specify a date for eliminating planet-warming emissions, instead calling for the elimination of fossil fuels from major economic sectors "as much as technologically feasible." It also avoids denouncing specific types of clean energy alternatives, specifically nuclear power, which in the past has come under fire from climate change activists despite being a zero-carbon form of energy. An early version of the resolution called for phasing out nuclear energy within a decade.
The resolution also sidesteps any discussion of carbon capture and storage technology, which Green New Deal supporters had previously criticized on the grounds that it would enable the continued use of fossil fuels.
Mr. Markey said the resolution is purposefully "silent on individual technologies."
Instead the resolution calls for generating all electricity through renewable sources like wind and solar within 10 years, eliminating greenhouse emissions in manufacturing and forestry "as much as is technologically feasible," and re-engineering cars and trucks to end climate pollution.
The measure also includes social justice goals not usually attached to antipollution plans, like eradicating poverty by creating high-paid jobs.
But the resolution goes far beyond that, touching on themes that are animating a rising left but rarely reach the halls of Congress. It aims to "promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities and youth."
Mr. Markey, who co-sponsored the failed cap-and-trade measure with former Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, said he thought the public was far more ready than in 2009 to support climate change legislation. A decade ago, he said, fossil-fuel backed interest groups poured money into convincing the public that climate change was not real.
"The green generation has risen up, and they are saying we want this issue solved," Mr. Markey said. "We now have the troops, we now have the money, and we're ready to fight."

‘It's crazy. It's loony': Republicans giddy as Democrats champion 'Green New Deal'

Full text: Prominent Democrats have rushed to embrace the "Green New Deal" — and Republicans couldn't be happier about it.
As liberal groups pressure presidential candidates and lawmakers to back the ambitious climate proposal, Republicans hope their opponents drift so far left that they will be vulnerable in 2020. Since the election of President Donald Trump — who dismisses the link between carbon emissions and rising temperatures — Republicans have steered clear of climate change, but in the Green New Deal they see a chance to pivot the argument back toward economics as growing majorities accept the underlying science.
“I would like them to push it as far as they can. I’d like to see it on the floor. I’d like to see them actually have to vote on it,” Rep. Mike Simpson of R-Idaho, a senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, told POLITICO. “It’s crazy. It’s loony.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump's most vocal champions, echoed that sentiment. “Let’s vote on the Green New Deal!” Graham tweeted Friday. “Americans deserve to see what kind of solutions far-left Democrats are offering to deal with climate change."
Trump on Saturday sarcastically called the proposal "Brilliant!" in a tweet.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced their Green New Deal vision on Thursday, with a nonbinding resolution that is just 14 pages long, For comparison, the cap-and-trade bill that passed in 2009 had 1,400 pages. This leaves myriad details to be worked out before Democrats would have actual legislation ready for the House floor.
Still, the resolution is more ambitious than any climate proposal previously floated on Capitol Hill: It calls for a 10-year “national mobilization” to move the U.S. economy off fossil fuels, provide health care for all, increase wages and expand union rights through a massive federal stimulus. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has indicated she has no immediate plans to bring the resolution up for a vote.
Several high-profile presidential candidates have already co-sponsored the resolution, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.
Republicans bashed the concept as technologically impossible, unimaginably costly and a “socialist fever dream” that they said would cost Democrats moderate seats across the country.
“I think this will be a piñata that Republicans will continue to hit and use to their advantage in the 2020 elections. It’s a policy piñata,” said Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist.
Ocasio-Cortez has said Democrats should not fear the coming GOP attacks.
"We have tried their approach for 40 years. For 40 years we have tried to let the private sector take care of this. They said, ‘We got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate,’" she told NPR on Thursday. "Except for the fact that there’s a little thing in economics called externalities. And what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don’t have to pay, but taxpayers have to pay.”
Other Democrats are not giving up on bipartisanship.
“Who knows what they’re cooking up on their side?” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a Green New Deal backer, said. “But I think we have some Republicans that have evolved on this issue and potentially even some partners in moving bipartisan things forward.”
Meanwhile, polls have shown growing acceptance of the link between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change — even among Republicans. Monmouth University polling from November, for example, found 64 percent of Republicans believe the science, up 15 percentage points from just three years prior. The poll also found 51 percent of GOP voters supported the government doing more to address the causes of climate change.
Conservative Republicans, like Environment Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming, are denouncing it as a "socialist manifesto." More moderate Republicans are avoiding that rhetoric, but say they would prefer more immediate — if incremental — advancements in innovation, boosting clean manufacturing, infrastructure projects and improving soil quality for farmers.
“I think everyone on our side would say that the Green New Deal is a little bit much,” Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, a senior Energy and Commerce Republican, told reporters.
Others see early signs that the progressive faction might paint Pelosi into an unworkable position that could end up costing Democrats seats.
“There’s this new wave of Democrats that make Pelosi look moderate, and I never thought I’d see that day,” said Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, the Energy and Commerce Committee's top-ranking Republican. “You see this Green New Deal rollout, you see Medicare for all rollout and you don’t see her buying into those proposals in any great embrace. I think it’s going to be important for the American people to understand the consequences of those proposals.”
Another Republican, Florida Rep. Francis Rooney didn’t discount the climate aims of the Green New Deal, but noted it had “big goals but there’s nothing of substance to figure out how to get there.” He favored technological innovation and a price on carbon to drive down emissions, like the bipartisan carbon fee legislation he’s offered.
George David Banks, a former climate and international energy adviser to Trump, said the Democrats' proposal should not be dismissed out of hand, praising elements such as calls to address soil health or increase research and development.
“If you’re pretty clear that a significant part of the Green New Deal isn’t based in political reality or economic reality but there is some common ground that would win the support of most Americans, I think that’s fine,” said Banks, who is now executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation.
That tenor emerged in the run-up to Ocasio-Cortez and Markey unveiling their plan. Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee emphasized the need for research spending, noting they agreed with scientists that greenhouse gases from human activity are warming the planet.
Given that a number of high-profile House Democrats have declined the co-sponsor the Green New Deal, such as Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone of New Jersey and Climate Crisis Chairwoman Kathy Castor (Fla.), there appears to be enough of a political middle to strike bipartisan deals, said Rich Powell, executive director at ClearPath, who testified at the Energy and Commerce hearing.
“It seems like a lot of folks are tacking toward a more moderate position on this,” said Powell, whose group advocates for research and development in emissions-reduction technology like next-generation nuclear power and carbon capture and for sequestration for coal and natural gas power plants.
The tone differed in the House Natural Resources Committee. Republicans downplayed climate change by pointing to warmer periods during the world’s history. Scientists say combustion of greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels and other sources has driven levels of carbon dioxide and average temperatures much higher than they normally would be given the planet’s position and angle relative to the sun.
Industry and conservative groups are ready to give such sentiments backing. Many came out strong against the Green New Deal, demonstrating that Republican allies off the Hill would keep a close eye on how members position themselves.
“The Green New Deal is nothing more than the latest job-killing, socialist wish list from the radical left obsessed with climate change, Medicare-For-All, free college, and a total redistribution of wealth,” Club for Growth President David McIntosh said in a statement.

Full text: It's the beginning of a friendship the internet didn't know it needed.
Chrissy Teigen, the (unofficial) mayor of Twitter, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, renowned Instagrammer and Instant Pot chef, are supposedly watching the Grammy Awards together. And there's pizza involved.
Teigen put out a plea to the Democratic congresswoman on Friday.
"hello my hero, do you wanna come over and watch the grammys with us? there will be pizza," Teigen tweeted.
"Modern Family" actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who will apparently also be at this pizza party, sweetened the deal by offering up his own slices.
"She can have my portion!" he responded.
Naturally, Ocasio-Cortez accepted the offer.
"yes! we can live-tweet me burning something in the kitchen," the congresswoman said.
"perfect! we have extremely different strengths except I still sometimes burn things," Teigen wrote back.
The internet proceeded to lose its mind.
"NAME A BETTER DUO, I'LL WAIT," tweeted Jules Suzdaltsev.
"I am absolutely here for this friendship," Becky Holloman tweeted.
Here's everything you need to know to watch the Grammys on Sunday. But if you'd rather watch Teigen and Ocasio-Cortez watch the Grammys, well ... you're not alone.

A Texas council member called Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a ‘bimbo’ on Twitter. He has deleted his account.

Full text: A Dallas-area elected official has apologized after calling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) a "bimbo" in a now-deleted tweet directed at the congresswoman.
Scott Dunn, a member of the city council in Richardson, Tex., replied to Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter with the offending remarks, according to images of the tweet that circulated online last week.
"The embarrassment is to have bimbos like you with nothing between your ear," Dunn wrote.
It's unclear to which of the congresswoman's tweets he was responding. As of Saturday morning, Dunn's Twitter account was deactivated.
Dunn later said he was trying to defend President Trump after the State of the Union address, according to the Dallas Morning News. The day after the speech, Ocasio-Cortez called the event an "embarrassment" after some criticized her for not applauding Trump and looking "sullen" in the audience.
In a Facebook post Friday, Dunn apologized for his Twitter reply to Ocasio-Cortez, according to the New York Daily News. The post was no longer publicly visible as of Saturday morning.
"The words I used were offensive," Dunn reportedly wrote. "I am responsible for my own words and actions. I apologize to anyone who finds what I said offensive."
Dunn did not immediately respond to a request from The Washington Post for comment on Saturday.
Even after Dunn's Twitter account was deactivated, images of his tweet made the rounds on social media, prompting a few calls for him to resign.
Mauri Long, a candidate for Richardson City Council, said she found the tweet "inappropriate, demeaning and divisive."
"As one of only two women running for City Council, I find this sort of locker room talk disturbing and personally offensive," Long wrote in a post on her campaign's Facebook page. "This type of caustic rhetoric by an elected representative of our great city is not reflective of our own values."
Amir Omar, a former Richardson City Council member, also condemned Dunn's remarks as unbecoming of an elected official.
"I really don't care what political team you root for and whether you like one representative or another," Omar wrote. "I don't even care that although you are representing a city in a nonpartisan role, you can't hold your tongue out of basic decorum. What I do care about is that you are so tone deaf that you don't realize that using sexist terms like this one reflects badly on our City."
On Friday, Richardson Mayor Paul Voelker said he was "extremely disappointed and embarrassed" by Dunn's comments and had since talked to the councilman.
"While I certainly respect Councilman Dunn's, or any citizen's, right to freely express his or her opinion on any issue of public concern, I also believe that Richardson's values are best upheld when we engage in civic discourse that is civil in tone, respectful of others and designed to produce constructive outcomes for the betterment of our community," Voelker said in a statement.
"Even when we disagree about important political and social issues, we shouldn't resort to name-calling," the mayor added.
Ocasio-Cortez upset longtime congressman Joseph Crowley in their Democratic primary race last year, and quickly became a popular target of the right even before she took office. As The Post's Elise Viebeck reported last month, Republican lawmakers and pundits have mocked everything from Ocasio-Cortez's appearance to her background:
There are new examples all the time. Republicans Ed Rollins and Rush Limbaugh recently dismissed Ocasio-Cortez as a "little girl" and "some young uppity." The Washington Examiner's Eddie Scarry tweeted a photo of her in November and wrote that she doesn't "look like a girl who struggles." The Daily Caller promoted what it described as a possible "nude selfie" of her last week before walking back its headline.
In return, Ocasio-Cortez has frequently clapped back at her critics online and in interviews. She did not, however, appear to respond to Dunn's "bimbos" tweet.
Dunn has served on the city council in Richardson since 2011, according to his bio.

Full text: Boris Epshteyn, Sinclair's chief political analyst and dedicated Trump propagandist, tried to get go after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter Monday.
Poor Boris.
He set out to mock her for what he thought was her confusing the INF missile treaty with the IMDb movie and TV database. Only what he was attacking her for was not something she wrote but rather something written on a parody account of her, an account that was clearly labeled as such at the top.
Ocasio-Cortez was flagged to it, and she tweeted out his mistake to her 3 million Twitter followers.
Way to go, Boris.
Here the former Trump communications aide tried to save face with more belligerence.
And he keeps going rather than admitting his mistake. Here he addresses the Congresswoman directly.
Remember back in 2017 when Sinclair was making its bid to buy Tribune Media and it hired this propagandist, and I said it looked like Sinclair could be on its way to becoming not just the largest but also the most reviled brand in broadcasting?
I will say no more.

Top stories
The Morrison government has suffered a historic defeat, losing the first substantive vote on the floor of the House of Representatives since 1929 , after Labor and the crossbench stared down a bare-knuckle tactical offensive by the Coalition, including late advice that the medical evacuations bill was unconstitutional. The bill cleared the House after a day of high brinksmanship in Canberra, which started with backroom negotiations between Labor and key crossbenchers to adjust legislation passed by the Senate last December, and culminated with the government producing advice from the solicitor general that the proposal breached section 53 of the constitution. Katharine Murphy writes in her analysis of the evening’s events that while Scott Morrison has endured an acute parliamentary humiliation, his objective now will be to try to translate that into an electorally productive border protection war with Labor. And although Bill Shorten’s decision to project some basic humanity in an election year is a risk, it shouldn’t be.
Meanwhile on Nauru, three Iranian women found to be refugees but still living there have talked to Guardian Australia about how they feel about the refugee medical transfer bill . From this distance, 3,340km off the coast from Brisbane, the debate is not political but existential. “I can’t trust the politicians nor the doctors,” says Sahar. “If the bill was to pass, many severely sick and defenceless humans will be rescued from ongoing torture,” says Hajar. “My six-year experience of endurance with the Australian refugee policies doesn’t allow me to be optimistic about this bill,” says Bita. “Nauru is equal to hopelessness.” In Canberra, debate has coalesced on what a defeat on this issue will mean for the Morrison government and Labor opposition.
After six years of drought, Mount Isa residents prayed for rain. Then it flooded. For an unbroken stretch of 43 stinking afternoons, the temperature at Cloncurry and Camooweal had topped 40C. Then one Monday, the temperature dropped. The next day it started to rain. “It was magnificent, we all cheered,” says Marcus Curr, who owns Yelvertoft station, about 100km north of Mount Isa. “Then it rained and it rained and it rained.” The scale of devastation in the north-west and the Gulf country has been described as an “inland tsunami”. There are about 1.5 million cattle in the Gulf, and some estimates are that one in three died in the flood waters.
World
Mexico’s most notorious drug lord, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán has been convicted on drug-trafficking charges. New York jurors – whose identities were kept secret – reached a verdict after deliberating six days in the case, sorting through what authorities called an “avalanche” of evidence.
The Trump administration is still taking young children away from their parents when they cross the US-Mexico border unlawfully, despite formally ending the policy of family separations last summer, according to immigration advocates in Texas. At a rally in Texas – where a BBC cameraman was shoved and abused – Donald Trump told the crowd that construction of his border wall had begun. That is not true. His response to the border deal reached to avoid a government shutdown was: “I can’t say I’m happy. I can’t say I’m thrilled.”
The UK’s Home Office has been condemned for working with the Zimbabwean government to accelerate the deportation of asylum seekers , despite high-profile human rights abuses in the country.
Russia, sparking Great Firewall fears, is planning to temporarily disconnect from the internet as part of what it says is an experiment to test its cyberdefence capabilities. According to a report on the Russian news site RBC, the planned disconnection is intended to analyse the country’s preparedness for a draft law mandating a “sovereign” internet.
A new book claims 80% of the priests working at the Vatican are gay, including some of the most senior clerics in the Catholic church who have vociferously attacked homosexuality.
Opinion and analysis
When Coles launched their Little Shop promotion in 2018, there was extensive criticism of the campaign , which encouraged shoppers to collect the 30 plastic miniatures of household goods. Campaigners dubbed it an “environmental nightmare”. Now, as the supermarket giant launches another collectables campaign filled with plastic figures, environment groups say they are still cleaning up discarded Little Shop toys.
Postnatal depression is prolific. As many as one in seven women will experience it. But as the ABC’s new thriller The Cry demonstrates, a new mother’s feelings of inadequacy, failure and even anger can come from everywhere. “I thought I was making a story about a woman struggling with postnatal depression and maybe some other undiagnosed psychosis as well,” director Glendyn Ivin tells Anna Spargo-Ryan. There’s a hint of alarm in his voice as he says, “ I really thought I was exaggerating.”
The Australian National University has been making headlines for its analysis that Australia will achieve its Paris agreement targets five years early – with the current rate of renewable energy growth. It’s an assessment that surprised many experts with detailed knowledge of Australia’s climate and energy policy, among them Bill Hare: “The ANU briefing, possibly inadvertently, creates the impression that all that would be required is a continuation of the recent rate of renewable energy deployment. That is simply not the case, not without major policy interventions, which are unlikely – at least under the current government.”
Sport
The revamped NRL All Stars game takes place in Melbourne on Friday night. There, the Indigenous and Maori players involved will be celebrating and adding to their communities’ already long and storied history in the game.
Gordon Banks, who has died aged 81, was the best goalkeeper England have had and is widely regarded as one of the finest to have played for any side in any era. He was also responsible for what many consider the greatest save in history.
Thinking time: how AOC won Twitter
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman to be elected to Congress last November, has built one of the most engaged followings on Capitol Hill in just eight months. “How does she do it?” asks Guardian US’s audience engagement editor Max Benwell. “I spend my days analysing data for the Guardian, so I’m used to digging into numbers and figuring out what gets people going. And more often than not, it’s the less obvious things that reveal what’s really happening. For example, AOC is fluent in emoji. It may not sound like much to anyone who regularly uses emojis, but this is big for a member of Congress. Remember when Hillary asked people to sum up how people felt about student debt in three emojis?
“Then there was her dancing tweet, after she was ‘outed’ for dancing in a spoof music video in college. The original footage was posted by a strange, seemingly rightwing account looking to undermine her. In response, she posted another video of her dancing, to Edwin Starr’s song War (the one that goes “what is it good for?”). Just when you think you’ve seen all the possible fact-checks, clapbacks, and details from her past, she comes out dancing.”
Media roundup
Scott Morrison’s historic defeat in parliament yesterday is dominating front pages this morning, with the Australian choosing the headline, in scare quotes, “ Blame Shorten for boats” and the Daily Telegraph going with Grin Reapers beneath a photograph of Kerryn Phelps, Julia Banks and Rebekha Sharkie. One in five Australian women between the ages of 30 and 39 are reconsidering having children or more children over climate change fears, the ABC reveals. The Townsville Bulletin reports that a woman has died after contracting a bacterial infection linked to flooding.

A Senate inquiry is due to hand down its report into the then-Turnbull government’s grant of $444m to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation last year.

Full text: Boris Epshteyn, Sinclair’s chief political analyst and dedicated Trump propagandist, tried to get go after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter Monday.
Poor Boris.
He set out to mock her for what he thought was her confusing the INF missile treaty with the IMDb movie and TV database. Only what he was attacking her for was not something she wrote but rather something written on a parody account of her, an account that was clearly labeled as such at the top.
Ocasio-Cortez was flagged to it, and she tweeted out his mistake to her 3 million Twitter followers.
Way to go, Boris.
Here the former Trump communications aide tried to save face with more belligerence.
And he keeps going rather than admitting his mistake. Here he addresses the Congresswoman directly.
Remember back in 2017 when Sinclair was making its bid to buy Tribune Media and it hired this propagandist, and I said it looked like Sinclair could be on its way to becoming not just the largest but also the most reviled brand in broadcasting?
I will say no more.

Full text: 25.000 emplois perdus: le géant de la vente en ligne Amazon a annoncé jeudi qu'il ne construirait finalement pas de nouveau siège à New York face à l'hostilité grandissante de nombreux élus locaux, en phase avec une aile gauche du parti démocrate de plus en plus remontée contre les grands patrons.
"Après beaucoup de réflexion et de délibérations, nous avons décidé de ne pas aller de l'avant avec nos plans de construire un nouveau siège" dans le quartier new-yorkais du Queens, a annoncé Amazon sur son blog d'entreprise.
"Un certain nombre de personnalités politiques locales ont dit clairement qu'elles s'opposaient à notre présence et ne travailleraient pas avec nous pour établir le genre de relations dont nous avons besoin pour concrétiser le projet", a justifié l'entreprise dirigée par Jeff Bezos, première fortune mondiale.
L'hostilité était montée ces dernières semaines: plusieurs élus locaux dénonçaient pèle-mêle les quelque 3 milliards d'avantages fiscaux promis à l'entreprise, une gentrification accélérée prévisible du quartier de Long Island City retenu par Amazon, ou encore la saturation du métro dans le quartier concerné.
Ils déploraient aussi le rejet des syndicats par Amazon et l'absence de concertation publique lors des négociations avec le maire et le gouverneur de New York sur le projet.
- "Cupidité d'Amazon"
Témoin du rejet total du mastodonte de Seattle par certains élus new-yorkais, beaucoup ont immédiatement applaudi l'abandon du projet. Sans montrer l'ombre d'un regret sur la perte de 25.000 emplois pour la capitale financière américaine, qui avait été sélectionnée par Amazon parmi une vingtaine de villes à la situation économique souvent bien moins favorable.
"Tout est possible: aujourd'hui, un groupe de New-Yorkais déterminés et leurs voisins ont vaincu la cupidité d'Amazon, son exploitation des travailleurs et le pouvoir de l'homme le plus riche du monde", s'est félicitée dans un tweet Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Cette élue du Queens, jeune star du Congrès américain, appartient à une nouvelle vague d'élus démocrates qui vilipendent régulièrement Wall Street et le grand capital.
Le maire de New York Bill de Blasio, qui avait oeuvré aux côtés du gouverneur démocrate de New York Andrew Cuomo pour attirer Amazon sur ses terres, a rejeté la responsabilité de cet échec sur l'entreprise.
"Nous avions offert à Amazon la possibilité d'être de bons voisins et de faire des affaires dans la plus formidable ville du monde", a-t-il affirmé dans un communiqué. "Amazon a rejeté cette possibilité. Nous avons les meilleurs talents du monde (...) Si Amazon ne reconnaît pas notre valeur, ses concurrents eux la verront".
Mais Andrew Cuomo, principal artisan du projet, semblait furieux.
Le projet aurait "apporté entre 25.000 et 40.000 emplois bien rémunérés à notre Etat, près de 30 milliards de dollars de revenus supplémentaires pour les transports en commun, le logement, les écoles", et il aurait "renforcé le statut de New York comme pôle émergent des hautes technologies", a-t-il souligné dans un communiqué.
"Mais un petit groupe d'élus a placé ses petits intérêts politiques au-dessus de ceux de la communauté", a-t-il déploré. Ils ont "causé des dommages considérables et devront être tenus pour responsables".
- Divisions démocrates
Le gouverneur visait notamment les sénateurs de l'Etat de New York qui avaient désigné un élu très critique d'Amazon, Michael Gianaris, au sein d'un mini-comité ayant le pouvoir de bloquer le projet.
Mais M. Gianaris, qui s'en était pris surtout aux 3 milliards d'avantages fiscaux promis à Amazon, s'est montré fier d'avoir contribué au renoncement du géant du commerce en ligne.
"Nous devons vraiment revoir cette tendance que nous avons à subventionner les grandes entreprises", a-t-il déclaré. "Amazon est la plus grosse entreprise du pays, elle est dirigée par l'homme le plus riche du monde, elle n'avait pas besoin des 3 milliards".
Autre signe des divisions démocrates: Lloyd Blankfein, ancien PDG de Goldman Sachs et grand contributeur aux campagnes démocrates, a estimé que les élus opposés au projet, qui se disent "progressistes", étaient en réalité "anti-progrès et anti-démocratiques".
Reste à savoir si les New-Yorkais qui, dans les sondages jusqu'à encore récemment, s'étaient montrés majoritairement favorables au projet, en tiendront rigueur aux élus ayant chassé Amazon.
Jeudi, les réactions à Long Island City étaient contrastées, certains se disant "soulagés", d'autres déplorant la "courte vue" des opposants au projet.
Amazon, qui emploie 645.000 personnes dans le monde, a précisé ne pas chercher de site, "à ce stade", pour remplacer l'implantation new-yorkaise. Mais le groupe prévoit toujours de construire un nouveau siège de 25.000 personnes dans la banlieue de Washington, un projet qui avait été annoncé même temps que le projet new-yorkais, sans susciter de telles critiques.

Journalist Jemele Hill speaks at Chapman

Full text: Publication: The Panther, Chapman University, Orange CA.
Jemele Hill is a sports journalist, currently working for The Atlantic as a staff writer. In 2018, Hill was named national journalist of the year by the National Association of Black Journalists , according to NABJ’s website. Photo by Cassidy Keola
Sports journalist Jemele Hill came to Jeff Pearlman’s sports journalism class at Chapman to discuss her “impressive, cool and funky” career.
Those are Pearlman’s words, which is one way to describe her experience working for Michigan State University’s newspaper, ESPN and The Atlantic.
Hill compared journalism to the comic book hero, Batman.
“It’s not the hero you need, it’s the hero you deserve … It’s a thankless job, to some extent,” Hill said to the class. “You have to be willing to plow through some things you may not want to do.”
Hill said she has relocated to three different areas in the past year – Connecticut, Washington, D.C., and California. Hill said this is just part of the lifestyle. But what she isn’t used to is facing a controversy of her own.
Hill recently came under fire after her since-deleted tweet Feb. 5 that read, “Nah, she gotta yell: GETCHO HAND OUT MY POCKET.” This was in response to Showtime’s Desus Nice’s tweet wanting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to yell “Whose mans is this?” during President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech.
Many called Hill’s tweet a reference to the Malcolm X assassination because the same phrase was yelled seconds before the activist was shot in the chest in 1965. When asked about her thoughts before, during and after the tweet, she looked down, smiled and took a deep breath.
“Given some absurd elements of the State of the Union, at that point, I think I was mostly in a joking mode,” Hill told The Panther. “When I tweeted it, I thought nothing of it at all. It was up for hours; it was up for basically a day before there was any reaction.”
Hill said she realizes many took offense to the tweet, but she didn’t want for her words to be misconstrued.
“You don’t do (journalism) with the idea of becoming rich or famous, because it’s likely not going to happen,” Hill said to the class. “You do it because you believe in something truthful and deeper … You almost have to commit to being in something bigger than yourselves.”
Hill said she played sports growing up and followed her favorite teams through the news. When she started high school, she realized she could combine her interests.
“I loved to tell stories and I was curious. Journalism seemed to check all the boxes for things I enjoyed,” Hill told The Panther.
She received an academic scholarship to Michigan State University, where she worked for the sports section in The State News, her college newspaper.
“I did not get into the profession to necessarily cover (wrestling, volleyball and softball), but the beauty of when you’re thrown into those situations is you end up learning things about sports you probably wouldn’t come into contact with (otherwise),” Hill said.
After graduating from college in 1997, Hill worked at the Raleigh News & Observer in North Carolina, but eventually moved to the Detroit Free Press in 1999, covering Michigan State University basketball and football. In November 2006, she joined ESPN where she began her sportscasting career. Since October 2018, Hill has worked for The Atlantic as a sports writer.
“The nature of the profession is to disrupt … to hold people accountable. It’s your job to ask those questions,” Hill said.

Full text: An affair in which nice activists came to hope that a vicious attack had in fact taken place
MAGA country is a no-go zone. The New York Times, January 29: Jussie Smollett, one of the stars of the Fox television show Empire, was attacked in Chicago … by two people who yelled racial and homophobic slurs and wrapped a rope around his neck, according to the police, who said they were investigating the incident as “a possible hate crime”. Smollett, who is black and publicly came out as gay in 2015, was walking on a downtown street when two people approached him and yelled the slurs … The attackers then began hitting Smollett in the face and poured an “unknown chemical substance” on him. One of the attackers also wrapped a rope around Smollett’s neck before the duo fled … Smollett told the police that the attackers yelled “this is MAGA country”, a reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan.
Entertainment Tonight, Twitter, January 30: BREAKING: Jussie Smollett has been hospitalised in Chicago after a possible homophobic and racially charged attack.
Democrat wunderkind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Twitter, January 30: This attack was not “possibly” homophobic. It was a racist and homophobic attack.
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, statement, January 29: (The) racist and homophobic attack on acclaimed actor and activist Jussie Smollett is troubling. The rise in hate crimes is directly linked to President Donald J. Trump’s racist and xenophobic rhetoric.
Democratic presidential hopeful Cory Booker, Twitter, January 30: The vicious attack on actor Jussie Smollett was an attempted modern-day lynching.
Chicago Fox 32 reporter Rafer Weigel, Twitter, January 30: Might be best to tone down the outrage on the #JussieSmollett story until more evidence comes in to suggest it actually happened.
Chad Griffin Human Rights Campaign, Twitter, February 14: From the moment #JussieSmollett came forward, there have been leaks & spin from some within the Chicago (police) that have been used to discredit and undermine him. This is exactly the treatment that victims of hate crimes fear and why they often stay silent.
Heather Mac Donald, City Journal, February 18: The Jussie Smollett case, in which a young black, gay actor has apparently concocted a tale of being attacked by two white men wearing MAGA hats and shouting anti-gay slurs, is just the latest example of how desperately media elites want to confirm their favoured narrative about America: that the country is endemically and lethally racist, sexist, and homophobic, and that the election of Donald Trump both proves and reinforces such bigotry. The truth: as instances of actual racism get harder and harder to find, the search to find such bigotry becomes increasingly frenzied and unmoored from reality.
Vox, February 21: Police have arrested and charged Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report … Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said that Smollett was allegedly unhappy with his salary, and the attack was staged to his benefit.
Andy Ngo, National Review, February 18:Jussie Smollett’s hoax is symptomatic of America’s illness. Because of the mainstreaming of academia’s victimhood culture, we are now in a place where we place more value on being a victim than on being heroic, charitable, or even kind. Victims … are supposed to be coveted … and believed unreservedly. Those who urge caution are treated as bigots.
