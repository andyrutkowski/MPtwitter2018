Our entire democracy is healthier when we increase voter turnout. We come to better collective decisions when more of us have a say.

That starts with:
- Election Day as a Federal Holiday

We triggered the first primary election in 14 years. OUR supporters collecting signatures in the bitter snow for 5 weeks did that.

No matter who the vote is for every single vote cast to day is ours - because we made this election happen.
A major point of my campaign: in the safest blue seats in America we should have leaders swinging for the most ambitious ideas possible for working-class Americans.

YouÄôre largely not going to get gutsy risk-taking from swing-district seats.

So it not luck. It mindfulness. :///bOqgvTv0bM

@macartney @MakeQueensSafer Yes apologies if that was unclear - the bike lanes have a very clear + serious why. 

I had meant addressing why local drivers are so worked up over it. At the core I think they want a safe neighborhood too - we can increase parking elsewhere to accommodate for the bike lane.
@david_mcphisto I was there. It played a large role in my decision to run. :///Co4LGpggG6
This is also why @repjoecrowley most recent support for a stronger police enforcement bill is so hurtful + wrong.

Our district includes RIKERS ISLAND. Increasing criminalization is NOT how we get safer.

We must focus healthcare education re-entry + jobs for our communities.
Basically real estate developers are buying off rezonings from elected officials via campaign finance.

This causes new buildings to bring in 100s/1000s more peoples into a neighborhood without making *any* public investments.

Schools sewage &amp; yes parking all get strained. /3

Truth is Dem establishment doesnÄôt like what the future looks like: ambitious progressive non-corporate big idea peoples who reject the notion that 5% better is good enough.

They also seem to believe that 20 years in the same seat isnÄôt enough time. :///ko3VxIMLrn

Wall Street folks are increasingly using employment as a sort of ransom for peoples to accept abusive jobs that do not provide adequate pay healthcare or sick/family leave.

A Federal Jobs Guarantee will put an end to that. By guaranteeing employment you take away the ransom./2

In NY not all students are funded equally.

Our state budget prevents us from seeing how much individual schools receive in funding.

That is completely wrong. A child zip code should never determine their destiny. It well beyond time we live up to that promise. :///FgkMIpJn71

When there is a public option for employment that guarantees a $15 living wage healthcare and paid leave then the private sector must now compete for labor on job quality.

This guarantee creates a job quality "floor" and is a strong deterrent to labor exploitation. /4

Legalize cannabis is clear.

Clarity isnÄôt radical. It common sense.
Democrats HAVE to lead on policies that materially improve the lives of working peoples. If not then what the point?

Middle of the road gets us nowhere - not now when the stakes are so high.

If we want our leaders to be more courageous then we as VOTERS must be more courageous too.

If youÄôre too scared to vote out a mediocre incumbent then donÄôt be surprised when theyÄôre too scared to vote well when it counts.

That how democracy works.
I keep things pretty real here:

Democrats arenÄôt exempt from the corrosive influence of corporations.

If weÄôre going to change this country for the better we need to get big money out of politics.

When I say Ocasio2018 campaigns on the issues I mean it.

We put specific policy commitments (like #MedicareForAll and #AbolishICE) on the back of all our posters since most are hung on store windows.

We have the courage to change the country and we will win because of it. :///SsJqEBUYWh
